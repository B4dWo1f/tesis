\chapter{Introduction}
In this work we study a variety of properties regarding defected graphene bilayer. Starting from the basic concepts of graphene, we build our way to the role of $sp^3$-defects in graphene bilayer such as chemisorbed Hydrogen adatoms.

First we study the properties of these defects one by one in isolated scenarios. Then we wonder the effects of neighboring defects
