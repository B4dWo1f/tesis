% Qsimulator

The initial goal of this thesis was the exploration of graphene based nuclear spin qubits, very much inspired in the proposal for nuclear spin qubits in Silicon by B. E. Kane\cite{Kane1988}, in 1988.
In the original paper the proposed system consists of $\ce{P}$ donors on a $\ce{Si}$ matrix. The $\ce{P}$ donors have a nuclear spin $I=1/2$
The control between the electronic and nuclear spin (for each $\ce{P}$ donor) was proposed via electric gating and a combination of external microwave and radio frequency pulses.
Our plan was to explore an implementation of a similar system in a completely different material: hydrogenated bilayer graphene.
Nevertheless, in the process of studying the spin interactions among qubits we thought of another application for this platform, namely, analog quantum simulation of fermionic lattice models that allows the study a broad class of emergent electronic properties and has the promise for not-so-long-term applications.
\medskip

% The quantum information would be stored in the nuclear spin of $\ce{H}$ adatoms chemisorbed on top of bilayer graphene and in order to interact with it we propose the use of electric gating which it is known to control the band gap of the system and, with it, the hyperfine interaction as well as the exchange interaction among adatoms.
% \smallskip

But let us start from the beginning. Every proposal for building qubits has to deal with two opposing requirements: the need for the qubits to be completely isolated from the environment and the need for them to interact quickly and strongly on demand so they can be read or written to.

Kane's proposal\cite{Kane1988}, ``A Silicon-based nuclear spin quantum computer'' deals with the first requirement in the following way. The quantum information is to be stored in the nuclear spin of Phosphorus atoms inserted in a matrix of Silicon ($\ce{Si}:\leftidx{^{31}}{\ce{P}}$). The $\ce{Si}$ was selected for its abundance of spinless nuclear isotopes in addition to the huge industry behind it, ensuring the know-how to manipulate this material as needed. Once the host material was chosen, the options for donors were quite limited, in fact it turns out that the only shallow donor in $\ce{Si}$ with nuclear spin $I=1/2$ is Phosphorus\cite{Feher1959,Wilson1961} and, in particular, the isotope $\leftidx{^{31}}{\ce{P}}$. In addition, a number of studies show that its nuclear spin relaxation time can exceed 10 hours\cite{Feher1959, Wilson1961, Waugh1988}. %, and it is likely to be as high as $10^{18}$ seconds for lower temperatures. % phonon

When $\ce{P}$ dopants are introduced in $\ce{Si}$, an electron is confined in the vicinity of the dopant. The extension of such state can be as large as hundreds of Ångströms so, if there are several dopants in the same area, the electronic states can act as an effective coupling among their nuclear spins\cite{Slichter1990}.

This approach takes advantage of the naturally weak interactions with the nuclear spin and the high tunability of the surrounding electronic states.
% The coupling of the nuclear and the electronic spin is mediated by the hyperfine interaction so the spin state can be transferred between the nucleus and the electrons.

% Three external parameters are necessary for this proposal: \begin{enumerate*}\item an electric gate above each donor to control the strength of the hyperfine interaction and, hence, the resonance frequency of the nuclear spins beneath them \item electric gates between the donors to turn on and off electron-mediated coupling between the nuclear spins \item a globally applied A.C. magnetic field to flip nuclear spins at resonance.\end{enumerate*}

The processes to control the qubits depend upon implementations. In the original proposal it was required to have an electric gate on top of each of the dopants. The idea would be to deform the electronic cloud in the vicinity of the $\ce{P}$ nucleus, as shown in \fref{kane_proposal}. The main effect of this deformation would be the increase/decrease the electronic density around the nucleus and with it the hyperfine interaction, resulting in a shift of the resonance frequency for the spin flip.
The interaction between different qubits could be switched on and off using electric gating as well although its implementation requires, among other things, the dopants to be at a very specific distance (with atomic precision), which is definitely a challenge in this platform. Similarly the idea is to increase/decrease the electronic density in the inter-qubit space in order to allow/prevent the propagation of the spin information.

% Morello? Experimental status?


Another big challenge is the detection of the spin state at any given time of any of the components. Although there is not an ultimate answer for this problem, there are many ideas to work around it. The simplest option could be the use of a number of qubits all in parallel so the macroscopic magnetization could be measured. Also, if the nuclear spins are incorporated into an electronic device it is possible to infer the nuclear spin based on the electronic properties.\cite{Kane1992,Wald1994,Stich1996,Dixon1997,Dobers1988,Stegner2006}. The most state-of-the-art implementation of this system has proven able to (destructively) read a single electronic spin state as well as read and manipulate single and double qubit systems\cite{Morello2010,Pla2012,Dehollain2014}.

\section{A nuclear spin based graphene quantum bit}
Our proposal replaces the $\ce{P}$ dopants in $\ce{Si}$ by $\ce{H}$ adatoms on bilayer graphene.
This system provides the same ingredients: a host with virtually no nuclear spin impurities,\footnote{The abundance of Carbon isotopes with nuclear spin $I=0$ is $\sim98.9\%$ (which could still be problematic, although that number for Silicon is $\sim92.2\%$) but, in principle, it should be possible to get isotopically pure Carbon.} a dopant with nuclear spin $I=1/2$ and a surrounding electronic spin $S=1/2$ spatially bounded to them.


The interaction with nuclear spin impurities in the host is a well known source of electronic spin decoherence for spin qubits\cite{}. %https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0201303.pdf
Therefore the small abundance of $\leftidx{^{13}}{\ce{C}}$ with nuclear spin $I=1/2$ isotopes makes graphene a good choice for the host material.

The nuclear-electron interaction, known as the hyperfine coupling, is finite only for $s$-orbitals, and the $1s$ level is the one binding the electron closest to the nucleus, making $\ce{H}$ a good candidate.
%
At the same time, the chemisorption of the $\ce{H}$ adatom binds strongly its electron to the $\pi$ electrons of graphene, removing most of it from the $s$-orbital, luckily the occupation of this orbital is highly tunable via electric gating. This tunability is a key element for this proposal since it is the mechanism that will allow us to switch on and off the interactions with the qubits.
\smallskip

% Interaction with host nuclear spins is a known source of electronic spin decoherence for spin qubits such as electrons confined in GaAs quantum dots. Therefore the  small relative abundance of C13, with I=1/2,  makes the choice of graphene a good option from this point of view

% (mira por ejemplo este paper de teoría, que seguro que cita experimentos  https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0201303.pdf).

% The purer composition of $\ce{C}$ will translate in less decoherence for the $\ce{H}$ nuclear spin, resulting in longer relaxation times.





The electronic states in graphene (and graphene bilayer) are known to be highly tunable. In particular, an external electric field would allow the control of their relevant properties such as the localization length.

% XXX picture of the system

The initial reason to consider bilayer graphene was the possibility of opening a band gap upon the application of an external electric field\cite{McCann2006, Castro2007, Oostinga2007, Zhang2009, Taychatanapat2010, Castro2010a, Ponomarenko2011, Allen2012, Sui2015}.
This conductor to insulator transition provides a handy knob to control the localization length of the electronic states which results in the control of its effective electron-electron interactions as well as the interactions with the nuclear spins.

Another advantage of using $\ce{H}$ adatoms on top of bilayer graphene over $\ce{Si}:\leftidx{^{31}}{\ce{P}}$ is that nowadays there are methods to place the $\ce{H}$ adatoms with atomic precision and in a reversible way\cite{elias2009,Brihuega2016,Brihuega2017}. Specifically around 20 $\ce{H}$ atoms have already been placed in a single sample and, in principle, there should be no physical limit since the process could be automatized for larger arrays.
\medskip

The study of the tunable interactions in this system led us to the realization that $\ce{H}$ adatoms on bilayer graphene provide a framework where localized states can be placed at will and where the interactions among them are highly tunable upon the application of an external electric field.
Such a system is the ideal playground to implement physical realizations of a wide variety of hamiltonians, the ultimate goal for analog quantum simulations.
%The ability to engineer physical system to realize model hamiltonians is a long wished goal in the analogue quantum simulations community.
Our analysis show that by carefully choosing the placement of the adatoms (the distance and relative position among them) one can engineer the electron-electron interactions to explore both weakly and strongly interacting regimes.
\bigskip

This situation in which we can create localized electronic states at will and engineer the electron-electron interactions is specially appealing after the recent discovery of an unconventional superconducting phase in twisted bilayer graphene\cite{Cao2018,Cao2018a}.
Even though it will not be discussed in the thesis, it is worth pointing out the similarities between our proposal and the newly found twisted bilayer graphene physics.
In order to get superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene two requirements are to be met. First, the twisting angle needs to take a very low (and particular) value. This requirement ensures the emergence of a Moire pattern which is responsible for the localization of electronic states in the boundaries between domains. These localized states result in the emergence of (almost) flat bands all over the Brillouin zone and very close to the Fermi energy. Second, the fine tuning of the filling factor is key to place the Fermi level in the middle of the flat bands and conveniently tune the electron-electron interaction.

In the case of twisted bilayers, the resulting phase diagram is quite similar to that of the cuprates family what may suggest a similar microscopic mechanism for superconductivity to appear. The big difference is that, while cuprates are a somewhat complex material, the chemistry of graphene has been very well known for a long time, and the behavior of the $p$ orbitals (rather than $d$ orbitals) is much simpler.
The low energy effective model of graphene is probably the most studied in the history of Condensed Matter Physics so one may expect that studying the complex problem of unconventional superconductivity would be easier in this case.

Nevertheless, it looks like superconductivity will not give up its secrets so easily since, even though the low energy Hamiltonian of graphene is very well known, its extension to the twisted bilayer is not so easy.
It is probably too soon to tell but the introduction of superconductivity in the graphene/2d-materials community may be a game changer for this hundred year old problem. % of superconductivity.

% In contrast I think this ``equidistance'' provides a privileged position to explore a number of interesting topics without loosing touch with experimental reality.
% \bigskip

This thesis revolves around graphene and graphene-based systems, with a special focus on the applications of a particular case: bilayer graphene.
%One can find a number of reasons for choosing graphene: it is (was) a relatively new material, it has many physically interesting properties and the potential for plenty of applications, it draws a lot of attention form the research community...
One could say that the scientific community may have gone through an ``interest bubble'' involving graphene and, as a consequence, it has been advertised as a miraculous material with the potential to change the world as we know it. I will not address the controversy of the almighty properties of graphene but I would like to briefly address the graphene hype within the scientific community.
In order to have a somewhat quantitative description of the graphene hype I have analyzed the book of abstracts of the APS March Meeting since 2005 until 2019.\footnote{notice that 2018 is missing since I could not find the pdf for the full book of abstracts. Also, 2020 edition was canceled, but the book of abstracts was available in advance.}
The analysis counts the number of abstracts containing a given term (or groups of terms) and normalizes the count to the total number of abstracts that year.
This quantity is a very rough estimate, of course, but the resulting count is arguably related to the interest of the condensed matter community on a certain topic.

The case of graphene, first block of bars in \fref{topics}, is very interesting, since one can see its raise since (almost) its discovery and the beginning of its decay. This trend is a strong indicator of a possible interest bubble, but I would like to point out the trend over the years of the terms next to it in \fref{topics}: topolog\textcolor{gray}{[y,ical]}, 2d, dirac, \textcolor{gray}{quantum-,spin-,anomalous-}hall, dichal\textcolor{gray}{cogenides, $\ce{MoS2}$, $\ce{WS2}$, $\ce{WSe2}$}\footnote{the terms in grey are grouped during the counting process}.
All of these terms are undoubtedly related to graphene an clearly they show a steadily growing trend.
\medskip

Graphene itself is very interesting and it probably deserves all the fame and attention that it gets, but I would argue that the importance of graphene lies in the fact that it has become the gateway for many other materials and even research branches.

The understanding of graphene has been the spark to start the race of two dimensional materials research. \ac{2dm} are a very interesting family of materials both form an applied point of view and from the perspective of fundamental research.
On one hand, any industry-related property (conductance tunability, magnetism...) becomes instantly interesting just because its 2D nature ensures smaller sizes and possibly cheaper products.
On the other hand their 2D nature place them right in the frontier between the classical and quantum regime: they are macroscopic (sometimes reaching millimeters) but being one atom thick there are non negligible quantum effects all over the place, what makes the fascinating from the fundamental physics point of view.
Since the discovery of graphene many other bidimensional materials have been synthesized: $\ce{MoS2}$, $\ce{WSe2}$, $\ce{MoTe2}$, $\ce{BN}$, $\ce{CrI3}$, $\ce{NbSe2}$, $\ce{TaS2}$, $\ce{MnBi2Te4}$... each with their unique set of properties and its list of possible applications in the rapidly growing field of Quantum Technologies. % Footnote to the flagship?
%But everything started with graphene.
Some of these materials will be mentioned during the thesis, but graphene will be the common thread. %through out the thesis.

%One of the most interesting properties of graphene is that, being two dimensional, it is all surface, and electrons living in surfaces respond strongly to external perturbations.
%If a superconductor is placed nearby, electrons in graphene will behave in a superconductor way\cite{},
%if placed on top of an insulator it will develop a gap\cite{}, if subjected to an external field its electronic states will be heavily modified.
%A material in which so many different states may appear is interesting in itself, so it is no wonder why having such a panoply of different phases at their disposal, scientists quickly thought of the possibility of mixing different 2D materials in order to engineer properties at will\cite{Geim2013}.

%In the spirit of these combined structures, commonly known as Van der Waals heterostructures, this thesis extensively explores the properties and applications of a bilayer of graphene.
%TODO meh....change
%\bigskip



% The reason to focus on bilayer graphene was that it presents a property that is really hard to find in other materials. Bilayer graphene undergoes a transition from conductor to insulator in the presence of an electric field.
% Opening and closing a gap is a very powerful resource when dealing with electronic states since it affects the spatial localization of the electrons and many properties depend on this. In particular it is very interesting to consider a number of quasi-localized electronic states placed at the correct distance for the change in localization via gap-opening to influence their interactions.
% Even, going one step further, it is not far-fetched to think of an scenario in which we can combine the this tunable gap with some spin interactions being able to tune the electronic states for each spin channel independently.
% \bigskip


%Considering this playground of tunable gaps and electrically controlled  localization lengths we considered the role of defects in bilayer graphene and their behavior under the influence of external fields. In particular Hydrogen, $\ce{H}$, chemisorbed adatoms will play a major role in this thesis.
%
%This kind of defects produce quasi-localized electronic states around them, and the localization length of these states is strongly determined by the band gap in the system. Without going into much detail for now, we focused in the spin interactions in such a system. On one hand the chemisorbed $\ce{H}$ atoms trap a single electron ($S=1/2$) in their vicinity, on the other hand, their nucleus consists of a single proton ($I=1/2$), and the interaction between them is controlled, again, by the spreading of the electronic state.

\bigskip
The rest of this thesis is structured as follows. \chref{ch:graphene} and \chref{ch:bilayer} review the basic properties of graphene and bilayer graphene respectively, as well as most of the methods of calculation used along the thesis.

\chref{ch:vacancy} is based on the publication [\cite{Garcia-Martinez2017}] and it explores a number of properties of $sp^3$ defects on graphene.

\chref{ch:vacancy_bilayer} expands onto the effects of $sp^3$ defects on bilayer graphene.

\chref{ch:hyperfine} explores the tunability of the hyperfine coupling

\chref{ch:designer} studies the possibilities of $\ce{H}$ adatoms on bilayer graphene as a platform to perform analogue quantum simulations.



\newpage









%Following these lines, this thesis has somewhat been driven by a proposal dating all the way back to 1988\cite{Kane1988} on how to build a \emph{quantum computer}. In this proposal Bruce E. Kane suggested Phosphorus impurities in Silicon ($\ce{Si}:\leftidx{^{31}}{\ce{P}}$) as the building block for a silicon based nuclear spin quantum computer.

%Any proposal for building quantum computers (or qubits, for that matter) has to deal with the conflict between two opposing requirements. On one hand we need the qubits to be well isolated from the environment so interactions with the outside world does not affect the quantum state of the computer. On the other hand, we need to be able to interact strongly and quickly with the qubits in order to change or read its state.

%The idea to tackle this contradiction was to use the nuclear spin (1/2) of the $\leftidx{^{31}}{\ce{P}}$ to store information, due to the relatively low concentration of nuclear spins in the system, and the electric cloud around them as mediators among $\ce{P}$ impurities.
%The way to control the interactions would be based on the application of electric gates which would distort the electronic states increasing or decreasing the hyperfine interaction (coupling between the nuclear and the electronic spin) as well as tuning the electronic configuration in between defects.
%\medbreak

%Ignoring the specific nature of the materials involved, the relevant ingredients in this proposal are a nuclear spin 1/2, which is expected to be isolated from the rest of the universe upon the application of an electric field, An electronic spin 1/2 located somewhat around the nuclear spin and with a big response to an electric field so the interaction between the two spins can be highly tuned.

%We are today on the verge of a technological revolution, a quantum leap\footnote{pun intended} that holds the promise for a revolution in chemistry, pharmacology, telecommunications, virtually any application in which optimization is a problem and even Condensed Matter Physics itself.

%The laws of \ac{qm} started developing at the beginning of the XX century. At that moment, it was commonly thought that only a few details in the laws of Physics remained unexplained, but as Physicists delved deeper in these unexplained phenomena (namely the photo-electric effect and the black body radiation), it became clear that there was some missing piece.

%Step by step it was found that as the energy scales of the experiments grew smaller, the well-founded laws of \emph{classical} physics started failing.
%% infrared catastrophe
%% atomic model (electron radiation)
%The development and understanding of the laws of \ac{qm} was fast and in merely 30 years there were entire research fields centered already in different aspects or applications of it.

%Of particular interest to this thesis is the line of material science and condensed matter physics research. Prior to the understanding of \ac{qm}, there was no theory to explain the properties of any material.
%Whether a piece of rock was able to conduct heat or electricity was essentially a matter of trial and error. Of course some experimental observations led Chemists to build a collection of somewhat empirical laws and group elements based on similar properties, but there was no microscopic understanding of the mechanisms leading to these properties.

%The capabilities of \ac{qm} to predict electronic properties of different materials led to a revolution in science, technology and ultimately society. The extensive research on semiconductor materials during the 1960s was key to the invention of the transistor: a device that can block or allow the flow of electrical current at will.

%The transistor is the basic building block for any electronic device. Nowadays there are millions if not billions of transistors in our computers or smartphones, but only a few thousand were enough to send 3 humans to the moon (and back!). For the last 50 years, transistors have operated based on the fine-tune of the band population of two neighboring materials creating an effective potential barrier between them preventing electrons to move freely.
%As the electronic industry developed the need for smaller transistors became apparent, the smaller the transistors are, the more can be fit in a particular device.
%This race towards miniaturization pushed the development of new materials and techniques to size down transistors all the way to the current\footnote{In mass production, there are plenty of claims for smaller transistors.} $\sim\SI{14}{\nm}$. As expected, when we shrink the components of the transistors, we approach a limit in which quantum effects irrelevant until now may take a major role. The simplest obstacle that the shrinking of transistors have to deal with is the quantum tunnel effect, by which the electrons would be able to flow through the potential barrier, rendering the transistor unable to effectively stop electric current.

%% Quantum technologies
%Nowadays we are barely getting a glimpse of the potential of quantum technologies to impact technology and science in general, but Quantum computation is not something that we just thought about.
%Ever since we started the race to shrink every computer component, we headed towards the limit of quantum computation. A transistor is a device able to switch on and off an electrical current on command. They are the basic building block for any kind of computerized device. The first transistors were macroscopic, some centimeters and wired by hand. As the potential of computers grew, the need to create more, cheaper and smaller transistors launched the race for miniaturization. %Moore's Law is the empir
%Nowadays a single transistor is the size of a few nanometers. At this scale  quantum effects start playing a significant role.
%If there is a potential barrier stopping the electric current and it becomes smaller and smaller at some point the tunnel effect will be probable enough to render the transistor unable to stop any electric current at all.
%This is one of the simplest limitations that computers face as we miniaturize components.
%
%While it may seem that dealing with the inevitable quantum effects is a big inconvenience, scientists began to consider the possibility of using these effects to our benefit.
%The first ideas about the possibilities for quantum computing started in the 80s and 90s\cite{Benioff1980, Feynman1982, Manin1980, Shor1994} showed that a quantum computer could tackle problems that a classical computer simply could not.

%% Graphene
%In general, states near surfaces are very susceptible to external biases. In particular, \ac{2d} materials present highly manipulable electronic states since they only have the surface to live in.
%Even before its discovery, graphene has drawn a lot of attention. Many of its properties were expected well twenty years before its experimental discovery. While it is arguably true that there has been an over-hype bubble around its supposed miraculous applications, it is definitely true that graphene has been the gateway towards a whole new realm of phenomena in condensed matter physics.
%
%Initially most of its interest relied in the expectancy of a new Hall phase emerging without the need of an external magnetic field\cite{Kane2005a,Ostrovsky2008} and the experimental observation of the \ac{qhe}, a macroscopic effect of a purely quantum phenomenon\cite{Zhang2005}.
%Also fact that some high-energy physics models were naturally realized in graphene was a huge motivation for this material to hoard the attention of a big part of the condensed matter community.

%Certainly graphene has many interesting properties, but when two layers of graphene are placed one on top of each other there is a property that will be central for the development of this thesis.

But the bare necessity is not enough to develop the necessary technology. The first computers used \emph{macroscopic transistors} and \emph{macroscopic bits} when they were introduced.

%The relation between research in fundamental Physics and technological innovations is not always easy to see. In the best of cases, it usually takes some years, at least a few decades, for fundamental research to find its way into the industry.
%While this is a completely fair question, it is quite short-sighted. Let us think of the latest revolution that changed our society.
%The introduction of computers in our everyday life and the access to a global network of communications was a revolution, maybe even comparable to the industrial revolution.

%We have had computers in most households for the last 30 years, broad access to the internet for over 20, yet, trying to pin-point the fundamental research that took us there is quite hard, if not impossible.

Quantum Mechanics gives us the tools to describe any problem that we want to describe. From superconductors to topological phases or spin liquids, the Hamiltonian is known and yet we cannot solve it. The last fifty or sixty years of condensed matter physicist have been devoted to approximations and simplifications that would allow us to strip the problems to its basic components in an attempt to understand the microscopical mechanism behind so many interesting phenomena.
%The thorough investigation of a variety of problems while not completely successful in every area, has had a great side effect. The cumulative experience of decades of condensed matter physics research has granted us the ability to control matter with atomic precision in a wide range of situations. The fulfillment of such a dream\cite{Feynman1982}

%In this work we study a variety of properties regarding defected graphene bilayer. Starting from the basic concepts of graphene, we build our way to the role of sp$^3$-defects in graphene bilayer such as chemisorbed Hydrogen adatoms.
%First we study the properties of these defects one by one in isolated scenarios. Then we wonder the effects of neighboring defects
