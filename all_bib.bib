abstract = {Recent experimental work on locally gated graphene layers resulting in p-n junctions has revealed the quantum Hall effect in their transport behavior. We explain the observed conductance quantization, which is fractional in the bipolar regime and an integer in the unipolar regime, in terms of quantum Hall edge modes propagating along and across the p-n interface. In the bipolar regime, the electron and hole modes can mix at the p-n boundary, leading to current partition and quantized shot-noise plateaus similar to those of conductance, whereas in the unipolar regime transport is noiseless. These quantum Hall phenomena reflect the massless Dirac character of charge carriers in graphene, with particle/hole interplay manifest in mode mixing and noise in the bipolar regime.},

abstract = {Weather forecasting has become an important field of research in the last few decades. In most of the cases the researcher had attempted to establish a linear relationship between the input weather data and the corresponding target data. But with the discovery of nonlinearity in the nature of weather data, the focus has shifted towards the nonlinear prediction of the weather data. Although, there are many literatures in nonlinear statistics for the weather forecasting, most of them required that the nonlinear model be specified before the estimation is done. But since the weather data is nonlinear and follows a very irregular trend, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has evolved out to be a better technique to bring out the structural relationship between the various entities. The paper examines the applicability of ANN approach by developing effective and reliable nonlinear predictive models for weather analysis also compare and evaluate the performance of the developed models using different transfer functions, hidden layers and neurons to forecast maximum, temperature for 365 days of the year.},

abstract = {A far-reaching goal of graphene research is exploiting the unique properties of carriers to realize extreme nonclassical electronic transport. Of particular interest is harnessing wavelike carriers to guide and direct them on submicron scales, similar to light in optical fibers. Such modes, while long anticipated, have never been demonstrated experimentally. In order to explore this behavior, we employ superconducting interferometry in a graphene Josephson junction to reconstruct the real-space supercurrent density using Fourier methods. Our measurements reveal charge flow guided along crystal boundaries close to charge neutrality. We interpret the observed edge currents in terms of guided-wave states, confined to the edge by band bending and transmitted as plane waves. As a direct analog of refraction-based confinement of light in optical fibers, such nonclassical states afford new means for information transduction and processing at the nanoscale.},

abstract = {The development of spintronics devices relies on efficient generation of spin-polarized currents and their electric-field-controlled manipulation. While observation of exceptionally long spin relaxation lengths makes graphene an intriguing material for spintronics studies, electric field modulation of spin currents is almost impossible due to negligible intrinsic spin-orbit coupling of graphene. In this work, we create an artificial interface between monolayer graphene and few-layer semiconducting tungsten disulphide. In these devices, we observe that graphene acquires spin-orbit coupling up to 17 meV, three orders of magnitude higher than its intrinsic value, without modifying the structure of the graphene. The proximity spin-orbit coupling leads to the spin Hall effect even at room temperature, and opens the door to spin field effect transistors. We show that intrinsic defects in tungsten disulphide play an important role in this proximity effect and that graphene can act as a probe to detect defects in semiconducting surfaces.},

Here, we show that graphene grown by chemical vapour deposition on copper is equally promising for spintronics applications. In contrast to natural graphene, our experiments demonstrate that chemically synthesized graphene has a strong spin-orbit coupling as high as 20 meV giving rise to a giant spin Hall effect. The exceptionally large spin Hall angle {\~{}}0.2 provides an important step towards graphene-based spintronics devices within existing complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology. Our microscopic model shows that unavoidable residual copper adatom clusters act as local spin-orbit scatterers and, in the resonant scattering limit, induce transverse spin currents with enhanced skew-scattering contribution. Our findings are confirmed independently by introducing metallic adatoms-copper, silver and gold on exfoliated graphene samples.},

There are specialized treatises on various aspects of the founda- tions of quantum mechanics, but they do not integrate those topics into the standard pedagogical material. I hope to remove that unfortunate dichotomy, which has divorced the practical aspects of the subject from the interpreta- tion and broader implications of the theory.

abstract = {Graphene is an extraordinary two-dimensional (2D) system with chiral charge carriers and fascinating electronic, mechanical and thermal properties. In multilayer graphene, stacking order provides an important yet rarely explored degree of freedom for tuning its electronic properties. For instance, Bernal-stacked trilayer graphene (B-TLG) is semi-metallic with a tunable band overlap, and rhombohedral-stacked trilayer graphene (r-TLG) is predicted to be semiconducting with a tunable band gap. These multilayer graphenes are also expected to exhibit rich novel phenomena at low charge densities owing to enhanced electronic interactions and competing symmetries. Here we demonstrate the dramatically different transport properties in TLG with different stacking orders, and the unexpected spontaneous gap opening in charge neutral r-TLG. At the Dirac point, B-TLG remains metallic, whereas r-TLG becomes insulating with an intrinsic interaction-driven gap {\~{}}6 meV. In magnetic fields, well-developed quantum Hall (QH) plateaux in r-TLG split into three branches at higher fields. Such splitting is a signature of the Lifshitz transition, a topological change in the Fermi surface, that is found only in r-TLG. Our results underscore the rich interaction-induced phenomena in trilayer graphene with different stacking orders, and its potential towards electronic applications.},

abstract = {Graphene nanoribbons will be essential components in future graphene nanoelectronics. However, in typical nanoribbons produced from lithographically patterned exfoliated graphene, the charge carriers travel only about ten nanometres between scattering events, resulting in minimum sheet resistances of about one kilohm per square. Here we show that 40-nanometre-wide graphene nanoribbons epitaxially grown on silicon carbide are single-channel room-temperature ballistic conductors on a length scale greater than ten micrometres, which is similar to the performance of metallic carbon nanotubes. This is equivalent to sheet resistances below 1 ohm per square, surpassing theoretical predictions for perfect graphene by at least an order of magnitude. In neutral graphene ribbons, we show that transport is dominated by two modes. One is ballistic and temperature independent; the other is thermally activated. Transport is protected from back-scattering, possibly reflecting ground-state properties of neutral graphene. At room temperature, the resistance of both modes is found to increase abruptly at a particular length--the ballistic mode at 16 micrometres and the other at 160 nanometres. Our epitaxial graphene nanoribbons will be important not only in fundamental science, but also--because they can be readily produced in thousands--in advanced nanoelectronics, which can make use of their room-temperature ballistic transport properties.},

abstract = {In the field of topological insulators, the topological properties of quantum states in samples with simple geometries, such as a cylinder or a ribbon, have been classified and understood during the past decade. Here we extend these studies to a M{\"{o}}bius band and argue that its lack of orientability prevents a smooth global definition of parity-odd quantities such as pseudovectors. In particular, the Chern number, the topological invariant for the quantum Hall effect, lies in this class. The definition of spin on the M{\"{o}}bius band translates into the idea of the orientable double cover, an analogy used to explain the possibility of having the quantum spin Hall effect on the M{\"{o}}bius band. We also provide symmetry arguments to show the possible lattice structures and Hamiltonian terms for which topological states may exist in a M{\"{o}}bius band, and we locate our systems in the classification of topological states. Then, we propose a method to calculate M{\"{o}}bius dispersions from those of the cylinder, and we show the results for a honeycomb and a kagome M{\"{o}}bius band with different types of edge termination. Although the quantum spin Hall effect may occur in these systems when intrinsic spin-orbit coupling is present, the quantum Hall effect is more intricate and requires the presence of a domain wall in the sample. We propose an experimental setup which could allow for the realization of the elusive quantum Hall effect in a M{\"{o}}bius band.},

abstract = {The blind application of machine learning runs the risk of amplifying biases present in data. Such a danger is facing us with word embedding, a popular framework to represent text data as vectors which has been used in many machine learning and natural language processing tasks. We show that even word embeddings trained on Google News articles exhibit female/male gender stereotypes to a disturbing extent. This raises concerns because their widespread use, as we describe, often tends to amplify these biases. Geometrically, gender bias is first shown to be captured by a direction in the word embedding. Second, gender neutral words are shown to be linearly separable from gender definition words in the word embedding. Using these properties, we provide a methodology for modifying an embedding to remove gender stereotypes, such as the association between between the words receptionist and female, while maintaining desired associations such as between the words queen and female. We define metrics to quantify both direct and indirect gender biases in embeddings, and develop algorithms to "debias" the embedding. Using crowd-worker evaluation as well as standard benchmarks, we empirically demonstrate that our algorithms significantly reduce gender bias in embeddings while preserving the its useful properties such as the ability to cluster related concepts and to solve analogy tasks. The resulting embeddings can be used in applications without amplifying gender bias.},

abstract = {Controlling long-distance quantum correlations is central to quantum computation and simulation. In quantum dot arrays, experiments so far rely on nearest-neighbour couplings only, and inducing long-distance correlations requires sequential local operations. Here, we show that two distant sites can be tunnel-coupled directly. The coupling is mediated by virtual occupation of an intermediate site, with a strength that is controlled via the energy detuning of this site. It permits a single charge to oscillate coherently between the outer sites of a triple dot array without passing through the middle, as demonstrated through the observation of Landau-Zener-St{\"{u}}ckelberg interference. The long-distance coupling significantly improves the prospects of fault-tolerant quantum computation using quantum dot arrays, and opens up new avenues for performing quantum simulations in nanoscale devices.},

abstract = {Iron, cobalt and nickel are archetypal ferromagnetic metals. In bulk, electronic conduction in these materials takes place mainly through the s and p electrons, whereas the magnetic moments are mostly in the narrow d-electron bands, where they tend to align. This general picture may change at the nanoscale because electrons at the surfaces of materials experience interactions that differ from those in the bulk. Here we show direct evidence for such changes: electronic transport in atomic-scale contacts of pure ferromagnets (iron, cobalt and nickel), despite their strong bulk ferromagnetism, unexpectedly reveal Kondo physics, that is, the screening of local magnetic moments by the conduction electrons below a characteristic temperature. The Kondo effect creates a sharp resonance at the Fermi energy, affecting the electrical properties of the system; this appears as a Fano-Kondo resonance in the conductance characteristics as observed in other artificial nanostructures. The study of hundreds of contacts shows material-dependent log-normal distributions of the resonance width that arise naturally from Kondo theory. These resonances broaden and disappear with increasing temperature, also as in standard Kondo systems. Our observations, supported by calculations, imply that coordination changes can significantly modify magnetism at the nanoscale. Therefore, in addition to standard micromagnetic physics, strong electronic correlations along with atomic-scale geometry need to be considered when investigating the magnetic properties of magnetic nanostructures.},

abstract = {We investigate the effect of spin-orbit coupling on the band structure of graphene-based two-dimensional Dirac fermion gases in the quantum Hall regime. Taking monolayer graphene as our first candidate, we show that a quantum phase transition between two distinct topological states—the quantum Hall and the quantum spin Hall phases—can be driven by simply tuning the Fermi level with a gate voltage. This transition is characterized by the existence of a chiral spin-polarized edge state propagating along the interface separating the two topological phases. We then apply our analysis to the more difficult case of bilayer graphene. Unlike in monolayer graphene, spin-orbit coupling by itself has indeed been predicted to be unsuccessful in driving bilayer graphene into a topological phase, due to the existence of an even number of pairs of spin-polarized edge states. While we show that this remains the case in the quantum Hall regime, we point out that by additionally breaking the layer inversion symmetry, a non-trivial quantum spin Hall phase can re-emerge in bilayer graphene at low energy. We consider two different symmetry-breaking mechanisms: inducing spin-orbit coupling only in the upper layer, and applying a perpendicular electric field. In both cases, the presence at low energy of an odd number of pairs of edge states can be driven by an exchange field. The related situation in trilayer graphene is also discussed.},

abstract = {Due to the recent cases of algorithmic bias in data-driven decision-making, machine learning methods are being put under the microscope in order to understand the root cause of these biases and how to correct them. Here, we consider a basic algorithmic task that is central in machine learning: subsampling from a large data set. Subsamples are used both as an end-goal in data summarization (where fairness could either be a legal, political or moral requirement) and to train algorithms (where biases in the samples are often a source of bias in the resulting model). Consequently, there is a growing effort to modify either the subsampling methods or the algorithms themselves in order to ensure fairness. However, in doing so, a question that seems to be overlooked is whether it is possible to produce fair subsamples that are also adequately representative of the feature space of the data set - an important and classic requirement in machine learning. Can diversity and fairness be simultaneously ensured? We start by noting that, in some applications, guaranteeing one does not necessarily guarantee the other, and a new approach is required. Subsequently, we present an algorithmic framework which allows us to produce both fair and diverse samples. Our experimental results on an image summarization task show marked improvements in fairness without compromising feature diversity by much, giving us the best of both the worlds.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

We show here how this phenomenon is naturally accommodated within a compositional distributional model of meaning. This model describes the meaning of a composite concept by accounting for interaction between its constituents via their grammatical roles. We give two illustrative examples to show how the qualitative phenomena are exhibited. We go on to apply the model to experimental data, and finally discuss extensions of the formalism.},

abstract = {Turing's (Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society 42:230–265, 1936) paper on computable numbers has played its role in underpinning different perspectives on the world of information. On the one hand, it encourages a digital ontology, with a perceived flatness of computational structure comprehensively hosting causality at the physical level and beyond. On the other (the main point of Turing's paper), it can give an insight into the way in which higher order information arises and leads to loss of computational control—while demonstrating how the control can be re-established, in special circumstances, via suitable type reductions. We examine the classical computational framework more closely than is usual, drawing out lessons for the wider application of information–theoretical approaches to characterizing the real world. The problem which arises across a range of contexts is the characterizing of the balance of power between the complexity of informational structure (with emergence, chaos, randomness and ‘big data' prominently on the scene) and the means available (simulation, codes, statistical sampling, human intuition, semantic constructs) to bring this information back into the computational fold. We proceed via appropriate mathematical modelling to a more coherent view of the computational structure of information, relevant to a wide spectrum of areas of investigation.},

abstract = {The spectral gap -- the difference in energy between the ground state and the first excited state -- is one of the most important properties of a quantum many-body system. Quantum phase transitions occur when the spectral gap vanishes and the system becomes critical. Much of physics is concerned with understanding the phase diagrams of quantum systems, and some of the most challenging and long-standing open problems in theoretical physics concern the spectral gap, such as the Haldane conjecture that the Heisenberg chain is gapped for integer spin, proving existence of a gapped topological spin liquid phase, or the Yang-Mills gap conjecture (one of the Millennium Prize problems). These problems are all particular cases of the general spectral gap problem: Given a quantum many-body Hamiltonian, is the system it describes gapped or gapless? Here we show that this problem is undecidable, in the same sense as the Halting Problem was proven to be undecidable by Turing. A consequence of this is that the spectral gap of certain quantum many-body Hamiltonians is not determined by the axioms of mathematics, much as Goedels incompleteness theorem implies that certain theorems are mathematically unprovable. We extend these results to prove undecidability of other low temperature properties, such as correlation functions. The proof hinges on simple quantum many-body models that exhibit highly unusual physics in the thermodynamic limit.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Topological insulators represent a new class of quantum phase defined by invariant symmetries and spin-orbit coupling that guarantees metallic Dirac excitations at its surface. The discoveries of these states have sparked the hope of realizing non-trivial excitations and novel effects such as a magnetoelectric effect and topological Majorana excitations. Here we develop a theoretical formalism to show that a three-dimensional topological insulator can be designed artificially via stacking bilayers of two-dimensional Fermi gases with opposite Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling on adjacent layers, and with interlayer quantum tunneling. We demonstrate that in the stack of bilayers grown along a (001)-direction, a non-trivial topological phase transition occurs above a critical number of Rashba bilayers. In the topological phase, we find the formation of a single spin-polarized Dirac cone at the -point. This approach offers an accessible way to design artificial topological insulators in a set up that takes full advantage of the atomic layer deposition approach. This design principle is tunable and also allows us to bypass limitations imposed by bulk crystal geometry.},

Here we address the problem of spin decoherence from the theoretical point of view. First we provide a short general overview of decoherence in open quantum systems and we discuss with some detail ambiguities that arise in the case of degenerate spectra, relevant for magnetic atoms. Second, we address the physical mechanisms that allows probing the spin coherence of magnetic atoms on surfaces. Third, we discuss the main spin decoherence mechanisms at work on a surface, most notably, Kondo interaction, but also spin-phonon coupling and dephasing by Johnson noise. Finally, we propose some schemes to engineer spin decoherence.},

Here we study how QST is destroyed and classical behaviour emerges in the case of magnetic adatoms, where, contrary to larger nanomagnets, the QST splitting is in some instances bigger than temperature and broadening. We analyze two different mechanisms for the renormalization of the QST splitting: Heisenberg exchange between different atoms, and Kondo exchange interaction with the substrate electrons. Sufficiently strong spin-substrate and spin-spin coupling renormalize the QST splitting to zero allowing the environmental decoherence to eliminate superpositions between classical states, leading to the emergence of spontaneous magnetization. Importantly, we extract the strength of the Kondo exchange for various experiments on individual adatoms and construct a phase diagram for the classical to quantum transition},

Reflectance difference spectroscopy in combination with ab initio calculations show that ultranarrow graphene nanoribbons have fully anisotropic optical properties dominated by excitonic effects that sensitively depend on the exact atomic structure. For N=7 armchair graphene nanoribbons, the optical response is dominated by absorption features at 2.1, 2.3 and 4.2 eV, in excellent agreement with ab initio calculations, which also reveal an absorbance of more than twice the one of graphene for linearly polarized light in the visible range of wavelengths.},

abstract = {The hallmark of a time-reversal symmetry protected topologically insulating state of matter in two-dimensions (2D) is the existence of chiral edge modes propagating along the perimeter of the system. To date, evidence for such electronic modes has come from experiments on semiconducting heterostructures in the topological phase which showed approximately quantized values of the overall conductance as well as edge-dominated current flow. However, there have not been any spectroscopic measurements to demonstrate the one-dimensional (1D) nature of the edge modes. Among the first systems predicted to be a 2D topological insulator are bilayers of bismuth (Bi) and there have been recent experimental indications of possible topological boundary states at their edges. However, the experiments on such bilayers suffered from irregular structure of their edges or the coupling of the edge states to substrate's bulk states. Here we report scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments which show that a subset of the predicted Bi-bilayers' edge states are decoupled from states of Bi substrate and provide direct spectroscopic evidence of their 1D nature. Moreover, by visualizing the quantum interference of edge mode quasi-particles in confined geometries, we demonstrate their remarkable coherent propagation along the edge with scattering properties that are consistent with strong suppression of backscattering as predicted for the propagating topological edge states.},

abstract = {We examine the existence of the interaction-generated quantum anomalous Hall phase on the honeycomb lattice. For the spinless model at half filling, the existence of a quantum anomalous Hall phase (Chern insulator phase) has been predicted using mean-field methods. However, recent exact diagonalization studies for small clusters with periodic boundary condition have not found a clear sign of an interaction-driven Chern insulator phase. We use exact diagonalization method to study properties of small clusters with open boundary condition and, contrary to previous studies, we find clear signatures of the topological phase transition for finite size clusters. We also examine applicability of the entangled-plaquette state (correlator-product state) ansatz to describe the ground states of the system. Within this approach the lattice is covered with plaquettes and the ground state wave-function is written in terms of the plaquette coefficients. Configurational weights can then be optimized using a variational Monte Carlo algorithm. Using the entangled-plaquette state ansatz we study the ground state properties of the system for larger system sizes and show that the results agree with the exact diagonalization results for small clusters. This confirms validity of the entangled-plaquette state ansatz to describe the ground states of the system and provides further confirmation of the existence of the quantum anomalous Hall phase in the thermodynamic limit, as predicted by the mean-field theory calculations.},

In high Landau levels these edge states are similar in structure to those of standard two-dimensional electron gas systems (s-2DEG's). The lowest Landau supports half as many edge states as those of higher Landau levels, leading to a quantization of the Hall conductance that is shifted relative to s-2DEG's. The presence of both hole-like and electron-like edge states is shown to lead to the existence of a domain wall at the edge of an undoped graphene armchair edge when one considers the effect of quantum Hall ferromagnetism. The domain wall supports both collective and charged gapless excitations whose consequences for tunnelling experiments are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We study the electrical transport in clean current annealed suspended bilayer graphene. We find two kind of devices. In bilayers of type B1 the eight-fold zero-energy Landau level (LL) is partially lifted above a threshold field revealing an insulating nu=0 quantum Hall state at the charge neutrality point (CNP). In bilayers of type B2 the LL lifting is full and a gap appears in the differential conductance even at zero magnetic field, suggesting an insulating spontaneously broken symmetry state. Unlike B1, the minimum conductance in B2 is not exponentially suppressed, but remains finite with a value G {\textless} e{\^{}}2/h even in a large magnetic field. We suggest that this phase of B2 is insulating in the bulk and bound by compressible edge states.},

We find that triplet oxygen retains its spin-polarized state when interacting with graphene or the nanotube. This leads to the formation of a weak bond with essentially no charge transfer between the molecule and the sheet or tube, as one would expect for a physisorptive bond. This result is independent on the approximation used for the exchange-correlation functional. The binding strength, however, depends strongly on the functional, reflecting the inability of current approximation functionals to deal correctly with dispersion forces. Gradient-corrected functionals yield very weak binding at distances around 4 {\AA}, whereas local density functional results yield substantially stronger binding for both graphene and the nanotube at distances of less than 3 {\AA}. The picture of oxygen physisorption is not substantially altered by the presence of topological defects such as 5–7 Stone–Wales pairs.},

abstract = {An alternating electric field, applied to a quantum dot, couples to the electron spin via the spin-orbit interaction. We analyze different types of spin-orbit coupling known in the literature and find two efficient mechanisms of spin control in quantum dots. The linear in momentum Dresselhaus and Rashba spin-orbit couplings give rise to a fully transverse effective magnetic field in the presence of a Zeeman splitting at lowest order in the spin-orbit interaction. The cubic in momentum Dresselhaus terms are efficient in a quantum dot with anharmonic confining potential and give rise to a spin-electric coupling proportional to the orbital mag-netic field. We derive an effective spin Hamiltonian, which can be used to implement spin manipulation on a time scale of 10 ns with the current experimental setups.},

@article{Graves2016,
abstract = {Modern computers separate computation and memory. Computation is performed by a processor, which can use an addressable memory to bring operands in and out of play. This confers two important benefits: the use of extensible storage to write new information and the ability to treat the contents of memory as variables. Variables are critical to algorithm generality: to perform the same procedure on one datum or another, an algorithm merely has to change the address it reads from. In contrast to computers, the computational and memory resources of artificial neural networks are mixed together in the network weights and neuron activity. This is a major liability: as the memory demands of a task increase, these networks cannot allocate new storage dynam-ically, nor easily learn algorithms that act independently of the values realized by the task variables. Although recent breakthroughs demonstrate that neural networks are remarkably adept at sensory processing 1 , sequence learning 2,3 and reinforcement learning 4 , cognitive scientists and neuroscientists have argued that neural networks are limited in their ability to represent variables and data structures 5–9 , and to store data over long timescales without interference 10,11 . We aim to combine the advantages of neu-ral and computational processing by providing a neural network with read–write access to external memory. The access is narrowly focused, minimizing interference among memoranda and enabling long-term storage 12,13 . The whole system is differentiable, and can therefore be trained end-to-end with gradient descent, allowing the network to learn how to operate and organize the memory in a goal-directed manner.},

abstract = {Close to charge neutrality, the electronic properties of graphene and its multilayers are sensitive to electron-electron interactions. In bilayers, for instance, interactions are predicted to open a gap between valence and conduction bands, turning the system into an insulator. In mono and (Bernal-stacked) trilayers, which remain conducting at low temperature, interactions do not have equally drastic consequences. It is expected that interaction effects become weaker for thicker multilayers, whose behaviour should converge to that of graphite. Here we show that this expectation does not correspond to reality by revealing the occurrence of an insulating state close to charge neutrality in Bernal-stacked tetralayer graphene. The phenomenology-incompatible with the behaviour expected from the single-particle band structure-resembles that observed in bilayers, but the insulating state in tetralayers is visible at higher temperature. We explain our findings, and the systematic even-odd effect of interactions in Bernal-stacked layers of different thickness that emerges from experiments, in terms of a generalization of the interaction-driven, symmetry-broken states proposed for bilayers.},

abstract = {We investigate whether quantum theory can be understood as the continuum limit of a mechanical theory, in which there is a huge, but finite, number of classical 'worlds', and quantum effects arise solely from a universal interaction between these worlds, without reference to any wave function. Here a `world' means an entire universe with well-defined properties, determined by the classical configuration of its particles and fields. In our approach each world evolves deterministically; probabilities arise due to ignorance as to which world a given observer occupies; and we argue that in the limit of infinitely many worlds the wave function can be recovered (as a secondary object) from the motion of these worlds. We introduce a simple model of such a 'many interacting worlds' approach and show that it can reproduce some generic quantum phenomena---such as Ehrenfest's theorem, wavepacket spreading, barrier tunneling and zero point energy---as a direct consequence of mutual repulsion between worlds. Finally, we perform numerical simulations using our approach. We demonstrate, first, that it can be used to calculate quantum ground states, and second, that it is capable of reproducing, at least qualitatively, the double-slit interference phenomenon.},

Here, we confirm the existence of EK edges in both graphene nanoribbons and on the edge of bulk graphene using atomic resolution imaging by aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy. The formation of the EK edge stems from sputtering and reconstruction of the zigzag edge. Density functional theory reveals minimal energy for EK edge reconstruction and bond distortion both in and out of plane, supporting our TEM observations.

abstract = {The search of new topological insulators that demonstrate the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is a cutting-edge research topic in condensed matter physics and materials science. So far, the QAHE has been observed only in Cr-doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 at extremely low temperature. Therefore, it is important to find new materials with large topological band gap and high thermal stability for the realization of the QAHE. Based on first-principles and tight-binding model calculations, we discovered a new class of topological phase{\$}-{\$}Chern half metal which manifests the QAHE in one spin channel while is metallic in the other spin channel{\$}-{\$}in Co or Rh deposited graphene. Meanwhile, these systems have large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy energies of 5.3 and 11.5 meV, necessary for the observation of the QAHE at reasonably high temperature.},

abstract = {The recently synthesized silicene as well as theoretically discussed germanene are examples of buckled honeycomb structures. The buckled structures allow one to manipulate asymmetry between two underlying sublattices of honeycomb structures. Here by taking germanene as a prototype of buckled honeycomb lattices, we explore magnetism induced by breaking sublattice symmetry through saturating chemical bonds on one side of the buckled honeycomb lattice. It is shown that when fractions of chemical bonds on one side are saturated, two narrow bands always exist at half filling. Furthermore, the narrow bands generally support flat band ferromagnetism in the presence of the Hubbard U interaction. The induced magnetization is directly related to the saturation fraction and is thus controllable in magnitude through the saturation fraction. Most importantly, we find that depending on the saturation fraction, the ground state of a one-side-saturated germanene may become a quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator characterized by a Chern number that vanishes for larger magnetization. The nonvanishing Chern number for smaller magnetization implies that the associated quantum Hall effect tends to survive at high temperatures. Our findings provide a potential method to engineer buckled honeycomb structures into high-temperature QAH insulators.},

abstract = {The LCAO, or Bloch, or tight binding, approximation for solids is discussed as an interpolation method, to be used in connection with more accurate calculations made by the cellular or orthogonalized plane-wave methods. It is proposed that the various integrals be obtained as disposable constants, so that the tight binding method will agree with accurate calculations at symmetry points in the Brillouin zone for which these calculations have been made, and that the LCAO method then be used for making calculations throughout the Brillouin zone. A general discussion of the method is given, including tables of matrix components of energy for simple cubic, face-centered and body-centered cubic, and diamond structures. Applications are given to the results of Fletcher and Wohlfarth on Ni, and Howarth on Cu, as illustrations of the fcc case. In discussing the bcc case, the splitting of the energy bands in chromium by an antiferromagnetic alternating potential is worked out, as well as a distribution of energy states for the case of no antiferromagnetism. For diamond, comparisons are made with the calculations of Herman, using the orthogonalized plane-wave method. The case of such crystals as InSb is discussed, and it is shown that their properties fit in with the energy band picture.},

The recent emergence of layered materials provides a laboratory for studying the interplay between internal quantum degrees of freedom of electrons. Here we report new coupling phenomena connecting real spin with layer pseudospins in bilayer WSe2. In polarization-resolved photoluminescence measurements, we observe large spin orientation of neutral and charged excitons by both circularly and linearly polarized excitation, with the trion spectrum splitting into a doublet at large vertical electrical field. These observations can be explained as a locking of spin and layer pseudospin in a given valley15, where the doublet implies an electrically induced spin splitting. The observed distinctive behaviour of the trion doublet under polarized excitation further provides spectroscopic evidence of interlayer and intralayer trion species, a promising step towards optical manipulation in van derWaals heterostructures through interlayer excitons.},

This novel electronic state of matter is gapped in the bulk and supports the transport of spin and charge in gapless edge states that propagate at the sample boundaries. The edge states are nonchiral, but they are insensitive to disorder because their directionality is correlated with spin. The spin and charge conductances in these edge states are calculated and the effects of temperature, chemical potential, Rashba coupling, disorder, and symmetry breaking fields are discussed.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA.

Interestingly, the two-dimensional form (graphene) was only obtained very recently, immediately attracting a great deal of attention. Electrons in graphene, obeying a linear dispersion relation, behave like massless relativistic particles. This results in the observation of a number of very peculiar electronic properties - from an anomalous quantum Hall effect to the absence of localization - in this, the first two-dimensional material.

abstract = {Recent theory predicted that the quantum spin Hall effect, a fundamentally new quantum state of matter that exists at zero external magnetic field, may be realized in HgTe/(Hg,Cd)Te quantum wells. We fabricated such sample structures with low density and high mobility in which we could tune, through an external gate voltage, the carrier conduction from n-type to p-type, passing through an insulating regime. For thin quantum wells with well width d {\textless} 6.3 nanometers, the insulating regime showed the conventional behavior of vanishingly small conductance at low temperature. However, for thicker quantum wells (d {\textgreater} 6.3 nanometers), the nominally insulating regime showed a plateau of residual conductance close to 2e(2)/h, where e is the electron charge and h is Planck's constant. The residual conductance was independent of the sample width, indicating that it is caused by edge states. Furthermore, the residual conductance was destroyed by a small external magnetic field. The quantum phase transition at the critical thickness, d = 6.3 nanometers, was also independently determined from the magnetic field-induced insulator-to-metal transition. These observations provide experimental evidence of the quantum spin Hall effect.},

abstract = {Theory of spin-orbit coupling in bilayer graphene is presented. The electronic band structure of the AB bilayer in the presence of spin-orbit coupling and a transverse electric field is calculated from first-principles using the linearized augmented plane wave method implemented in the WIEN2k code. The first-principles results around the K points are fitted to a tight-binding model. The main conclusion is that the spin-orbit effects in bilayer graphene derive essentially from the single-layer spin-orbit coupling which comes almost solely from the d orbitals. The intrinsic spin-orbit splitting (anticrossing) around the K points is about 24$\backslash$mu eV for the low-energy valence and conduction bands, which are closest to the Fermi level, similarly as in the single layer graphene. An applied transverse electric field breaks space inversion symmetry and leads to an extrinsic (also called Bychkov-Rashba) spin-orbit splitting. This splitting is usually linearly proportional to the electric field. The peculiarity of graphene bilayer is that the low-energy bands remain split by 24$\backslash$mu eV independently of the applied external field. The electric field, instead, opens a semiconducting band gap separating these low-energy bands. The remaining two high-energy bands are spin-split in proportion to the electric field; the proportionality coefficient is given by the second intrinsic spin-orbit coupling, whose value is 20$\backslash$mu eV. All the band-structure effects and their spin splittings can be explained by our tight-binding model, in which the spin-orbit Hamiltonian is derived from symmetry considerations. The magnitudes of intra- and interlayer couplings---their values are similar to the single-layer graphene ones---are determined by fitting to first-principles results.},

We also consider the intrinsic SOC in bilayer graphene, because the comparison between our tight-binding bilayer results and the density functional computations of Ref.[40] allows us to estimate the values of the trilayer SOC parameters as well. We also discuss the situation when a substrate or adatoms induce strong SOC in only one of the layers of bilayer or ABC trilayer graphene. Both for the case of intrinsic and externally induced SOC we derive effective Hamiltonians which describe the low-energy spin-orbit physics.

At half filling, it is expected that these states are prone to ferromagnetic instability, causing a very interesting type of edge ferromagnetism. Second, graphene under the influence of external perturbations can host a variety of topological insulating phases, including the conventional quantum Hall effect, the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) and the quantum spin Hall phase, in all of which phases conduction can only take place through topologically protected edge states. Here we provide an unified vision of the properties of all these edge states, examined under the light of the same one orbital tight-binding model.

abstract = {Conventional electronics are based invariably on the intrinsic degrees of freedom of an electron, namely its charge and spin. The exploration of novel electronic degrees of freedom has important implications in both basic quantum physics and advanced information technology. Valley, as a new electronic degree of freedom, has received considerable attention in recent years. In this paper, we develop the theory of spin and valley physics of an antiferromagnetic honeycomb lattice. We show that by coupling the valley degree of freedom to antiferromagnetic order, there is an emergent electronic degree of freedom characterized by the product of spin and valley indices, which leads to spin-valley-dependent optical selection rule and Berry curvature-induced topological quantum transport. These properties will enable optical polarization in the spin-valley space, and electrical detection/manipulation through the induced spin, valley, and charge fluxes. The domain walls of an antiferromagnetic honeycomb lattice harbors valley-protected edge states that support spin-dependent transport. Finally, we use first-principles calculations to show that the proposed optoelectronic properties may be realized in antiferromagnetic manganese chalcogenophosphates (MnPX3, X = S, Se) in monolayer form.},

abstract = {The electron-phonon interaction and related transport properties are investigated in monolayer silicene and MoS2 by using a density functional theory calculation combined with a full-band Monte Carlo analysis. In the case of silicene, the results illustrate that the out-of-plane acoustic phonon mode may play the dominant role unlike its close relative - graphene. The small energy of this phonon mode, originating from the weak sp2 bonding between Si atoms, contributes to the high scattering rate and significant degradation in electron transport. In MoS2, the longitudinal acoustic phonons show the strongest interaction with electrons. The key factor in this material appears to be the Q valleys located between the {\{}$\backslash$Gamma{\}} and K points in the first Brillouin zone as they introduce additional intervalley scattering. The analysis also reveals the potential impact of extrinsic screening by other carriers and/or adjacent materials. Subsequent decrease in the actual scattering rate can be drastic, warranting careful consideration. Finally, the effective deformation potential constants are extracted for all relevant intrinsic electron-phonon scattering processes in both materials.},

The magnitude of this ISOC is about {\$}0.46meV{\$}, 100 times larger than that of the monolayer graphene. The Hamiltonians including this ISOC in both momentum and real spaces are derived. Due to this ISOC, the low-energy states around the Dirac point exhibit a special spin polarization, in which the electron spins are oppositely polarized in the upper and lower layers. This spin polarization state is robust, protected by the time-reversal symmetry. In addition, we provide a hybrid system to select a certain spin polarization state by an electric manipulation.},

abstract = {The possibility that non-magnetic materials such as carbon could exhibit a novel type of s–p electron magnetism has attracted much attention over the years, not least because such magnetic order is pre- dicted to be stable at high temperatures. It has been demonstrated that atomic-scale structural defects of graphene can host unpaired spins, but it remains unclear under what conditions long-range magnetic order can emerge from such defect-bound magnetic moments. Here we propose that, in contrast to random defect distributions, atomic-scale engineering of graphene edges with specific crystallo- graphic orientation-comprising edge atoms from only one sub-lattice of the bipartite graphene lattice can give rise to a robust magnetic order. We use a nanofabrication technique based on scanning tunnelling microscopy to define graphene nanoribbons with nanometre precision and well defined crystallographic edge orientations. Although so-called ‘armchair' ribbons display quantum confinement gaps, ribbons with the ‘zigzag' edge structure that are narrower than nanometres exhibit an electronic bandgap of about 0.2–0.3 eV, which can be identified as a signature of interaction-induced spin ordering along their edges. Moreover, upon increasing the ribbon width, a semiconductor-to-metal transition is revealed, indicating the switching of the magnetic coupling between opposite ribbon edges from the antiferromagnetic to the ferromagnetic configuration. We found that the magnetic order on graphene edges of controlled zigzag orientation can be stable even at room temperature, raising hopes of graphene based spintronic devices operating under ambient conditions.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

In bilayer graphene (BLG), an electric field applied perpendicular to the basal plane breaks the inversion symmetry of the lattice, opening a band gap at the charge neutrality point. In a quantizing magnetic field, electron interactions can cause spontaneous symmetry-breaking within the spin and valley degrees of freedom, resulting in quantum Hall effect (QHE) states with complex order. Here, we report fractional QHE states in BLG that show phase transitions that can be tuned by a transverse electric field.

abstract = {Electronic and spintronic devices rely on the fact that free charge carriers in solids carry electric charge and spin. There are, however, other properties of charge carriers that might be exploited in new families of devices. In particular, if there are two or more minima in the conduction band (or maxima in the valence band) in momentum space, and if it is possible to confine charge carriers in one of these valleys, then it should be possible to make a valleytronic device. Valley polarization, as the selective population of one valley is designated, has been demonstrated using strain and magnetic fields, but neither of these approaches allows dynamic control. Here, we demonstrate that optical pumping with circularly polarized light can achieve complete dynamic valley polarization in monolayer MoS(2), a two-dimensional non-centrosymmetric crystal with direct energy gaps at two valleys. Moreover, this polarization is retained for longer than 1 ns. Our results, and similar results by Zeng et al., demonstrate the viability of optical valley control and suggest the possibility of valley-based electronic and optoelectronic applications in MoS(2) monolayers.},

abstract = {Since the lattices of ABA-stacked graphene multilayers with an even number of layers, as well as that of monolayer graphene, satisfy spatial-inversion symmetry, their electronic bands must be spin degenerate in the presence of time-inversion symmetry. In intrinsic monolayer and bilayer graphene, when symmetry is not broken by external fields, the only spin-orbit coupling present at low energy near the corner of the Brillouin zone is the Kane-Mele term, that opens a bulk energy gap but does not break the spin degeneracy of the energy bands [C. L. Kane and E. J. Mele, Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 226801 (2005)]. However, spin splitting is allowed in multilayers with an odd number of layers (greater than or equal to 3) because their lattices do not satisfy spatial inversion symmetry. We show that, in trilayer graphene, in addition to the Kane-Mele term, there is a second type of intrinsic spin-orbit coupling present at low energy near the corner of the Brillouin zone. It introduces a Zeeman-like spin splitting of the energy bands at each valley, with an opposite sign of the effective magnetic field in the two valleys. We estimate the magnitude of the effective field to be {\~{}}2T.},

In this study, 80 uropathogenic E. coli strains in 50 dogs and 30 cats suffering from UTI. In addition, 60 E. coli strains were isolated from fecal samples from 30 each of healthy dogs and cats. The distribution of VFs of uropathogenic E. coli strains isolated from dogs and cats suffering from urinary tract infections (UTI) were examined by the colony hybridization test with seven DNA probes specific for VFs, and the results were compared with those obtained in the studies on strains from humans with UTI. In uropathogenic E. coli strains isolated from dogs and cats suffering from UTI, VFs were detected as frequently as in the strains isolated from humans with UTI. Although less frequently, genes encoding these VFs especially pap, sfa, hly, and cnf 1 genes were also associated with E. coli strains isolated from feces of healthy cats, in contrast to the distribution pattern of uropathogenic E. coli observed in humans. Furthermore, all VFs except pil were significantly more frequently detected in strains isolated from urine of animals with cystitis than in those isolated from feces of healthy humans. These results indicate that VFs of E. coli contribute to the pathogenesis of UTI in dogs and cats.},

abstract = {The size of silicon transistors used in microelectronic devices is shrinking to the level at which quantum effects become important. Although this presents a significant challenge for the further scaling of microprocessors, it provides the potential for radical innovations in the form of spin-based quantum computers and spintronic devices. An electron spin in silicon can represent a well-isolated quantum bit with long coherence times because of the weak spin-orbit coupling and the possibility of eliminating nuclear spins from the bulk crystal. However, the control of single electrons in silicon has proved challenging, and so far the observation and manipulation of a single spin has been impossible. Here we report the demonstration of single-shot, time-resolved readout of an electron spin in silicon. This has been performed in a device consisting of implanted phosphorus donors coupled to a metal-oxide-semiconductor single-electron transistor-compatible with current microelectronic technology. We observed a spin lifetime of ∼6 seconds at a magnetic field of 1.5 tesla, and achieved a spin readout fidelity better than 90 per cent. High-fidelity single-shot spin readout in silicon opens the way to the development of a new generation of quantum computing and spintronic devices, built using the most important material in the semiconductor industry.},

abstract = {Despite efforts to recruit and retain more women, a stark gender disparity persists within academic science. Abundant research has demonstrated gender bias in many demographic groups, but has yet to experimentally investigate whether science faculty exhibit a bias against female students that could contribute to the gender disparity in academic science. In a randomized double-blind study (n = 127), science faculty from research-intensive universities rated the application materials of a student-who was randomly assigned either a male or female name-for a laboratory manager position. Faculty participants rated the male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than the (identical) female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant. The gender of the faculty participants did not affect responses, such that female and male faculty were equally likely to exhibit bias against the female student. Mediation analyses indicated that the female student was less likely to be hired because she was viewed as less competent. We also assessed faculty participants' preexisting subtle bias against women using a standard instrument and found that preexisting subtle bias against women played a moderating role, such that subtle bias against women was associated with less support for the female student, but was unrelated to reactions to the male student. These results suggest that interventions addressing faculty gender bias might advance the goal of increasing the participation of women in science.},

abstract = {Motivated by the concept of M$\backslash$"obius aromatics in organic chemistry, we extend the recently introduced concept of fragile Mott insulators (FMI) to ring-shaped molecules with repulsive Hubbard interactions threaded by a half-quantum of magnetic flux (hc/2e). In this context, a FMI is the insulating ground state of a finite-size molecule that cannot be adiabatically connected to a single Slater determinant, i.e., to a band insulator, provided that time-reversal and lattice translation symmetries are preserved. Based on exact numerical diagonalization for finite Hubbard interaction strength U and existing Bethe-ansatz studies of the one-dimensional Hubbard model in the large-U limit, we establish a duality between Hubbard molecules with 4n and 4n+2 sites, with n integer. A molecule with 4n sites is an FMI in the absence of flux but becomes a band insulator in the presence of a half-quantum of flux, while a molecule with 4n+2 sites is a band insulator in the absence of flux but becomes an FMI in the presence of a half-quantum of flux. Including next-nearest-neighbor-hoppings gives rise to new FMI states that belong to multidimensional irreducible representations of the molecular point group, giving rise to a rich phase diagram.},

abstract = {The spin of an electron or a nucleus in a semiconductor [1] naturally implements the unit of quantum information -- the qubit -- while providing a technological link to the established electronics industry [2]. The solid-state environment, however, may provide deleterious interactions between the qubit and the nuclear spins of surrounding atoms [3], or charge and spin fluctuators in defects, oxides and interfaces [4]. For group IV materials such as silicon, enrichment of the spin-zero 28-Si isotope drastically reduces spin-bath decoherence [5]. Experiments on bulk spin ensembles in 28-Si crystals have indeed demonstrated extraordinary coherence times [6-8]. However, it remained unclear whether these would persist at the single-spin level, in gated nanostructures near amorphous interfaces. Here we present the coherent operation of individual 31-P electron and nuclear spin qubits in a top-gated nanostructure, fabricated on an isotopically engineered 28-Si substrate. We report new benchmarks for coherence time ({\textgreater} 30 seconds) and control fidelity ({\textgreater} 99.99{\%}) of any single qubit in solid state, and perform a detailed noise spectroscopy [9] to demonstrate that -- contrary to widespread belief -- the coherence is not limited by the proximity to an interface.

abstract = {Differential geometry and topology have become essential tools for many theoretical physicists. In particular, they are indispensable in theoretical studies of condensed matter physics, gravity, and particle physics. Geometry, Topology and Physics, Second Edition introduces the ideas and techniques of differential geometry and topology at a level suitable for postgraduate students and researchers in these fields. The second edition of this popular and established text incorporates a number of changes designed to meet the needs of the reader and reflect the development of the subject. The book features a considerably expanded first chapter, reviewing aspects of path integral quantization and gauge theories. Chapter 2 introduces the mathematical concepts of maps, vector spaces, and topology. The following chapters focus on more elaborate concepts in geometry and topology and discuss the application of these concepts to liquid crystals, superfluid helium, general relativity, and bosonic string theory. Later chapters unify geometry and topology, exploring fiber bundles, characteristic classes, and index theorems. New to this second edition is the proof of the index theorem in terms of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. The final two chapters are devoted to the most fascinating applications of geometry and topology in contemporary physics, namely the study of anomalies in gauge field theories and the analysis of Polakov's bosonic string theory from the geometrical point of view. Geometry, Topology and Physics, Second Edition is an ideal introduction to differential geometry and topology for postgraduate students and researchers in theoretical and mathematical physics.},

abstract = {The 'standard' model of cosmology is founded on the basis that the expansion rate of the universe is accelerating at present — as was inferred originally from the Hubble diagram of Type Ia supernovae. There exists now a much bigger database of supernovae so we can perform rigorous statistical tests to check whether these 'standardisable candles' indeed indicate cosmic acceleration. Taking account of the empirical procedure by which corrections are made to their absolute magnitudes to allow for the varying shape of the light curve and extinction by dust, we find, rather surprisingly, that the data are still quite consistent with a constant rate of expansion. In the late 1990's, studies of Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) showed that the expansion rate of the universe appears to be accelerating as if dominated by a cosmological constant 1–3 . Since then supernova cosmology has devel-oped rapidly as an important probe of 'dark energy' . Empirical corrections are made to reduce the scatter in the observed magnitudes by exploiting the observed (anti) correlation between the peak luminosity and the light curve width and the colour 4,5 . Other such correlations have since been found e.g. with the host galaxy mass 6 and metallicity 7 . Cosmological parameters are then fitted, along with the parameters determining the light curves, by simple $\chi$ 2 minimisation 1,8–11 . This method has a number of pitfalls as has been emphasised earlier 12,13 . With ever increasing precision and size of SN Ia datasets, it is important to also improve the statistical analysis of the data. To accomodate model comparison, previous work 14–16 has introduced likelihood maximisation. In this work we present an improved maximum likelihood analysis, finding rather different results. Supernova Cosmology There are several approaches to making SN Ia 'standardiseable candles' . The different philosophies lead to mildly different results but the overall picture seems consistent 17 . In this paper we adopt the widely used approach of 'Spectral Adaptive Lightcurve Template 2′ (SALT2) 18,19 wherein the SN Ia are standardised by fitting their light curve to an empirical template, and the parameters of this fit are used in the cosmological analysis. (A more com-prehensive statistical model of light curves spanning optical through near-infrared data has subsequently been constructed in a hierarchical Bayesian framework 20). Every SN Ia is assigned three parameters, one being ⁎ m B , the apparent magnitude at maximum (in the rest frame 'B-band'), while the other two describe the light curve shape and colour corrections: x 1 and c. The distance modulus is then taken to be: µ $\alpha$ $\beta$ = − + − ⁎ m M x c, (1) B SN 1 where M is the absolute magnitude, and $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are assumed to be constants for all SN Ia. These global constants are fitted along with the cosmological parameters. The physical mechanism(s) which give rise to the correlations that underlie these corrections remain uncertain 21,22 . The SN Ia distance modulus is then compared to the expec-tation in the standard $\Lambda$ CDM cosmological model:},

abstract = {The electron-nuclear hyperfine interaction shows up in a variety of phenomena including e.g. NMR studies of correlated states and spin decoherence effects in quantum dots. Here we focus on the hyperfine coupling and the NMR spin relaxation time, {\$}T{\_}1{\$} in Weyl semimetals. Since the density of states in Weyl semimetals varies with the square of the energy around the Weyl point, a naive power counting predicts a {\$}1/T{\_}1T\backslashsim E{\^{}}4{\$} scaling with {\$}E{\$} the maximum of temperature ({\$}T{\$}) and chemical potential. By carefully investigating the hyperfine interaction between nuclear spins and Weyl fermions, we find that while its spin part behaves conventionally, its orbital part diverges unusually with the inverse of energy around the Weyl point. Consequently, the nuclear spin relaxation rate scales in a graphene like manner as {\$}1/T{\_}1T\backslashsim E{\^{}}2\backslashln(E/\backslashomega{\_}0){\$} with {\$}\backslashomega{\_}0{\$} the nuclear Larmor frequency. This allows us to identify an effective hyperfine coupling constant, which is tunable by gating or doping, which is relevant for decoherence effect in spintronics devices and double quantum dots where hyperfine coupling is the dominant source of spin-blockade lifting.},

abstract = {The scattering of two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions from local spin-orbit interactions with an origin in dilute concentrations of physisorbed atomic species on graphene is theoretically investigated. The hybridization between graphene and the adatoms' orbitals lifts spin and valley degeneracies of the pristine host material, giving rise to rich spin-orbit coupling mechanisms with features determined by the exact adsorption position on the honeycomb lattice - bridge, hollow or top position - and the adatoms' outer-shell orbital type. Effective graphene-only Hamiltonians are derived from symmetry considerations, while a microscopic tight-binding approach connects effective low-energy couplings and graphene-adatom hybridization parameters. Within the {\$}T{\$}-matrix formalism, a theory for (spin-dependent) scattering events involving graphene's charge carriers, and the spin-orbit active adatoms is developed. Spin currents associated with intravalley and intervalley scattering are found to tend to oppose each other. We establish that under certain conditions, hollow-position adatoms give rise to the spin Hall effect, through skew scattering, while top-position adatoms induce transverse charge currents via trigonal potential scattering. We also identify the critical Fermi energy range where the spin Hall effect is dramatically enhanced, and the associated transverse spin currents can be reversed.},

abstract = {Detection of nuclear spin precession is critical for a wide range of scientific techniques that have applications in diverse fields includ-ing analytical chemistry, materials science, medicine and biology. Fundamentally, it is possible because of the extreme isolation of nuclear spins from their environment. This isolation also makes single nuclear spins desirable for quantum-information proces-sing, as shown by pioneering studies on nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond 1–4 . The nuclear spin of a 31 P donor in silicon is very promising as a quantum bit 5 : bulk measurements indicate that it has excellent coherence times 6,7 and silicon is the dominant material in the microelectronics industry. Here we demonstrate electrical detection and coherent manipulation of a single 31 P nuc-lear spin qubit with sufficiently high fidelities for fault-tolerant quantum computing 8 . By integrating single-shot readout of the electron spin 9 with on-chip electron spin resonance 10 , we demon-strate quantum non-demolition 11 and electrical single-shot read-out of the nuclear spin with a readout fidelity higher than 99.8 per cent—the highest so far reported for any solid-state qubit. The single nuclear spin is then operated as a qubit by applying coherent radio-frequency pulses. For an ionized 31 P donor, we find a nuclear spin coherence time of 60 milliseconds and a one-qubit gate con-trol fidelity exceeding 98 per cent. These results demonstrate that the dominant technology of modern electronics can be adapted to host a complete electrical measurement and control platform for nuclear-spin-based quantum-information processing. Quantum computers have the potential to revolutionize aspects of modern society, ranging from fundamental science to information technology 12},

Observed in a multitude of materials, including damaged graphene and its disordered chemical derivatives(4-10), Anderson localization has not been seen in generic graphene, despite its resistivity near the neutrality point reaching approximate to h/e(2) per carrier type(4,5). It has remained a puzzle why graphene is such an exception. Here we report a strong localization and the corresponding metal-insulator transition in ultra-high-quality graphene. The transition is controlled externally, by changing the carrier density in another graphene layer placed at a distance of several nm and decoupled electrically. The entire behaviour is explained by electron-hole puddles that disallow localization in standard devices but can be screened out in double-layer graphene. The localization that occurs with decreasing rather than increasing disorder is a unique occurrence, and the reported double-layer heterostructures presents a new experimental system that invites further studies.},

abstract = {The electronic properties of both bulk and nanostructured semiconductors can be calculated using {\$}k.p{\$} theory (in the envelope approximation for inhomogeneous systems), tight-binding models, and pseudopotentials. {\$}k.p{\$} theory has the advantage of depending on material parameters that are directly related to experimentally measured quantities, unlike pseudopotentials and tight-binding models, but in its present formulation it is insensitive to the locations of individual atoms. We present a fourth approach using envelope functions on an arbitrary computational grid which taken to be the crystal lattice, thus providing an atomistic {\$}k.p{\$} theory. The atomistic limit necessarily introduces new physics by doubling the number of bands, breaking inversion symmetry, and by adding additional momentum matrix elements. When naively implemented the theory suffers from the well-known problem of non-Hermiticity in the presence of spatially varying material parameters. This can be resolved by modifying the computational cells, by using the finite volume method, or by starting from an inversion symmetric Bloch basis. We illustrate our method by constructing a four-band atomistic model for a diamond/zincblende crystal and show that it is equivalent to a well-known tight-binding model. We then take the atomistic limit of the widely used eight-band Kane model and compute the band-diagrams for all III-V semiconductors not containing nitrogen or boron. The numerical fits of the atomistic material parameters to experimental data are given. This new approach can be applied to nanostructures, impurities, and alloys. Our method also allows a new approach to multiscale modeling, by combining continuum and atomistic {\$}k.p{\$} models in the same structure.},

Here, by classifying the emotional arcs for a filtered subset of 1,737 stories from Project Gutenberg's fiction collection, we find a set of six core trajectories which form the building blocks of complex narratives. We strengthen our findings by separately applying optimization, linear decomposition, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning.

A comprehensive study of the molecular energetics and conformational dynamics that underlie these transformations is often limited to ensemble-averaging analytical techniques. Here we report the detailed investigation of a surface-catalysed cross-coupling and sequential cyclization cascade of 1,2-bis(2-ethynyl phenyl)ethyne on Ag(100). Using non-contact atomic force microscopy, we imaged the single-bond-resolved chemical structure of transient metastable intermediates. Theoretical simulations indicate that the kinetic stabilization of experimentally observable intermediates is determined not only by the potential-energy landscape, but also by selective energy dissipation to the substrate and entropic changes associated with key transformations along the reaction pathway.

Prospectively, employing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as versatile nanofillers would notably broaden the scope of functionalities. However, synthesizing MOFs in the form of freestanding nanosheets has proved challenging. We present a bottom-up synthesis strategy for dispersible copper 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate MOF lamellae of micrometre lateral dimensions and nanometre thickness. Incorporating MOF nanosheets into polymer matrices endows the resultant composites with outstanding CO2 separation performance from CO2/CH4 gas mixtures, together with an unusual and highly desired increase in the separation selectivity with pressure. As revealed by tomographic focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy, the unique separation behaviour stems from a superior occupation of the membrane cross-section by the MOF nanosheets as compared with isotropic crystals, which improves the efficiency of molecular discrimination and eliminates unselective permeation pathways. This approach opens the door to ultrathin MOF-polymer composites for various applications.},

abstract = {The goal of this article is to review the progress of three-electron spin qubits from their inception to the state of the art. We direct the main focus towards the resonant exchange (RX) qubit and the exchange-only qubit, but we also discuss other qubit implementations using three electron spins. The RX qubit is a qubit implementation in a triple quantum dot with the exchange interaction always turned on, hence, a modified version of the exchange-only qubit[1, 2]. For each three-spin qubit we describe the qubit model, the physical realization, the implementations of single-qubit operations, as well as the read-out and initialization schemes. Two-qubit gates and decoherence properties are discussed for the RX qubit and the exchange-only qubit, thereby, completing the list of requirements for a viable candidate qubit implementation for quantum computation. We start with describing the full system of three electrons in a triple quantum dot, then discuss the charge-stability diagram and restrict ourselves to the relevant subsystem, introduce the qubit states, and discuss important transitions to other charge states[3]. Introducing the various qubit implementations, we begin with the exchange-only qubit[2, 4], followed by the spin-charge qubit[5], the hybrid qubit[6, 7, 8], and the RX qubit[9, 10], discussing for each the single-qubit operations, read-out, and initialization methods, whereas the main focus will be on the RX qubit, whose single-qubit operations are realized by driving the qubit at its resonant frequency in the microwave range similar to electron spin resonance. Two different types of two-qubit operations are presented for the exchange-only and the RX qubit which can be divided into short-ranged and long-ranged interactions. Both of these interaction types can be expected to be necessary in a large-scale quantum computer. The short-ranged interactions use the exchange coupling by placing qubits next to each other and applying exchange-pulses[2, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], while the long-ranged interactions use the photons of a superconducting microwave cavity as a mediator in order to couple two qubits over long distances[16, 17]. The nature of the three-electron qubit states each having the same total spin and total spin in z-direction (same Zeeman energy) provides a natural protection of the qubit to several sources of noise[2, 18, 10, 19]. The price to pay for this improvement is an increase in gate complexity. We also take into account the decoherence of the qubit through the},

abstract = {Using micro-Raman spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy, we study the relationship between structural distortion and electrical hole doping of graphene on a silicon dioxide substrate. The observed upshift of the Raman G band represents charge doping and not compressive strain. Two independent factors control the doping: (1) the degree of graphene coupling to the substrate and (2) exposure to oxygen and moisture. Thermal annealing induces a pronounced structural distortion due to close coupling to SiO2 and activates the ability of diatomic oxygen to accept charge from graphene. Gas flow experiments show that dry oxygen reversibly dopes graphene; doping becomes stronger and more irreversible in the presence of moisture and over long periods of time. We propose that oxygen molecular anions are stabilized by water solvation and electrostatic binding to the silicon dioxide surface.},

The magnetic couplings between the adsorbates show a strong dependence on the graphene sublattice of chemisorption.

abstract = {We demonstrate a two-qubit Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm with single photons from a single InP quantum dot. The qubits are implemented via the spatial mode and the polarization of a single photon. Our photon source is operated both under continuous and pulsed excitation, the latter allowing deterministic quantum logic by generating photons on demand with a strong suppression of two-photon events. The computation reached a success probability of up to 79{\%}. We also exploit the concept of decoherence-free subspaces that helps to make our experimental setup robust against sources of phase noise. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.180501 PACS numbers: 03.67.Lx, 03.67.Pp, 42.50.Dv, 78.67.Hc In recent years, wide attention has been drawn to the implementation of quantum algorithms by solely using linear optics [1,2]. This approach is appealing since only standard optical components like beam splitters and phase shifters are used. It allows the optical simulation of smaller Hilbert spaces containing a limited number of qubits and can easily be cascaded for nontrivial small-scale computa-tions. Previous experimental demonstrations along this line focused on coherent photon states from attenuated laser pulses [3,4] or spontaneous parametric down-conversion [5] in order to simulate simple quantum algorithms [6] or to demonstrate concepts of noise resistant quantum com-putation [7]. However, these approaches suffer from an exponential increase of resources in terms of optical ele-ments and are thus not scalable to a large number of qubits [1]. The seminal proposal by Knill, Laflamme, and Milburn (KLM) [8], based on the implementation of the controlled sign-gate through teleportation [9], suggests a solution by using single-photon states and photon number resolving detectors to enable the efficient generation of a nonlinear fundamental two-photon gate. Subsequent theo-retical work [10] aimed at a reduction of the resources required to implement this gate. There are two key ingre-dients for the KLM scheme. First, a reliable on demand source for indistinguishable single photons that can be triggered and synchronized to a computer clock similar as in classical computation. Second, an interferometrically stable optical setup that operates on the single-photon level. Single-photon emitters based on quantum dots [11,12] have proven to be very robust sources. Important initial steps towards a realization of linear optical quantum computation (LOQC) were the demonstration of the indis-tinguishability of consecutive photons [13] and the tele-portation of an arbitrary photon state [14]. In this Letter, we take another step forward and demonstrate the on demand operation of a quantum algorithm using a triggered single-photon source. As a first implementation, we choose the two-qubit Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm [15,16] which often served in the past to demonstrate the applicability of a cer-tain physical system to a particular quantum computational task. Nuclear magnetic resonance [17,18], solid-state [19], and ion-trap [20] realizations have already been mastered. However, previous all-optical experiments were restricted to emulate the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm with attenuated classical laser pulses [3,4,7]. Here, we report an imple-mentation with a true deterministic single-photon source. Additionally, we extend our experiment to the demonstra-tion of noise tolerant encoding of qubits in single-photon states. An intuitive interpretation compares the two-qubit Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm with a ''coin tossing'' game: while a classical observer has to check both sides of a coin in order to tell if it is fair, i.e., if its two sides are different, quantum computation can perform this task with a single shot. In our implementation, the first qubit is encoded in the photon path, namely, the two spatial modes a and b. In a dual-rail representation, the logical state j0i L (j1i L) is associated with the physical state jai (jbi) which corresponds to the situation ''one photon in mode a (b).'' The second qubit is implemented via the photon's polar-ization state jHi jVi. The two qubits are initialized in the state j 0 i },

The GNRs considered have either armchair or zigzag shaped edges on both sides with hydrogen passivation. Both varieties of ribbons are shown to have band gaps. This differs from the results of simple tight-binding calculations or solutions of the Dirac's equation based on them. Our ab initio calculations show that the origin of energy gaps for GNRs with armchair shaped edges arises from both quantum confinement and the crucial effect of the edges. For GNRs with zigzag shaped edges, gaps appear because of a staggered sublattice potential on the hexagonal lattice due to edge magnetization. The rich gap structure for ribbons with armchair shaped edges is further obtained analytically including edge effects. These results reproduce our ab initio calculation results very well.},

abstract = {In this review we discuss the multifaceted problem of spin transport in hydrogenated graphene from a theoretical perspective. The current experimental findings suggest that hydrogenation can either increase or decrease spin lifetimes, which calls for clarification. We first discuss the spin–orbit coupling induced by local {\$}\backslashsigma -\backslashpi {\$} re-hybridization and {\$}{\{}\backslashbf s{\}}{\{}{\{}{\{}\backslashbf p{\}}{\}}{\^{}}{\{}3{\}}{\}}{\$} C–H defect formation together with the formation of a local magnetic moment. First-principles calculations of hydrogenated graphene unravel the strong interplay of spin–orbit and exchange couplings. The concept of magnetic scattering resonances, recently introduced by Kochan et al (2014 Phys. Rev. Lett. 112 116602) is revisited by describing the local magnetism through the self-consistent Hubbard model in the mean field approximation in the dilute limit, while spin relaxation lengths and transport times are computed using an efficient real space order N wavepacket propagation method. Typical spin lifetimes on the order of 1 ns are obtained for 1 ppm of hydrogen impurities (corresponding to a transport time of about 50 ps), and the scaling of spin lifetimes with impurity density is described by the Elliott–Yafet mechanism. This reinforces the statement that local defect-induced magnetism can be at the origin of the substantial spin polarization loss in the clean graphene limit.},

The trained Boltzmann machine is then used to generate spin states, for which we compare thermodynamic observables to those computed by direct MC sampling.

The phase diagram calculated in that way shows that, on the one hand, a large term of the latter kind destroys the topological nontrivial state. On the other hand, however, this inversion-symmetry-breaking field can enhance the topological state since for moderate values the transition from the nontrivial topological to the trivial Mott insulator is pushed to larger values of interaction U . This feature of an enhanced topological state is also found on honeycomb ribbons. With inversion symmetry, the edge of the zigzag ribbon is magnetic for any value of U . This magnetic moment destroys the gapless edge mode. Lifting inversion symmetry allows for a finite region in interaction strength U below which gapless edge modes exist.},

The effect is quantified in terms of Weyl functions for the density operators of the photons and illustrated with particular examples. The scheme employs the generalized phase factor as a mechanism for information transfer from the photons to the electric charges.

Low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy imaging of irradiated graphene on different substrates enabled us to identify a common twofold symmetry point defect. Our first-principles calculations reveal that the structure of this type of defect accommodates two adjacent missing atoms in a rearranged atomic network formed by two pentagons and one octagon, with no dangling bonds. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements on divacancies generated in nearly ideal graphene show an electronic spectrum dominated by an empty-states resonance, which is ascribed to a nearly flat, spin-degenerated band of $\pi$-electron nature. While the calculated electronic structure rules out the formation of a magnetic moment around the divacancy, the generation of an electronic resonance near the Fermi level reveals divacancies as key point defects for tuning electron transport properties in graphene systems.

abstract = {Further development of the field of all-electric spintronics requires the successful integration of spin transport channels with spin injector/generator elements. While with the advent of graphene and related 2D materials high performance spin channel materials are available, the use of nanostructured spin generators remains a major challenge. Especially promising for the latter purpose are 3D topological insulators, whose 2D surface states host massless Dirac Fermions with spin-momentum locking. Here, we demonstrate injection of spin-polarized current from a topological insulator into graphene, enabled by its intimate coupling to an ultrathin Bi 2 Te 2 Se nanoplatelet within a van der Waals epitaxial heterostructure. The spin switching signal, whose magnitude scales inversely with temperature, is detectable up to ∼15 K. Our findings establish topological insulators as prospective future components of spintronic devices wherein spin manipulation is achieved by purely electrical means.},

abstract = {Vacancy in graphene has been proposed to give rise to magnetism, from experimental and theo-retical results. Several calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) have been reported in the past decade: these studies yielded widely varying results of magnetic moment in the range of µ = 1.04−2.0 µ B . We present a theoretical study of the defect using two approaches, cluster models and periodic boundary conditions. We also apply two different formalisms, pure DFT and hybrid DFT including a fraction of Hartree Fock exchange. We show that the differences in magnetization found for the vacancy are caused by fractional electron occupation of the upper valence bands, that cross the Fermi level when we use DFT, an effect of the self-interaction error. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the use of the hybrid functional retrieves the correct magnetic properties yielding a final magnetization of µ = 2µ B .

The fact that the metric of the 3-form fields coming from string theory is field dependent (unlike in Kaloper-Sorbo) leads to the backreaction issues recently studied in axion monodromy models within string theory. We reanalyse these problems in terms of the 4-forms focusing on the case in which the non-periodic scalars backreact on the Kahler metric of the inflaton reducing the physical field range. In the closed string sector of Type II Calabi-Yau compactifications with fluxes the metric becomes field dependent precisely when ∆$\phi$ ∼ M p , independently of the choice of fluxes. We propose, however, some counter-examples to this universal behaviour by including open string fields.},

However, it may also appear at zero magnetic field if time-reversal symmetry is broken. Charge-neutral bilayer graphene is unstable to a variety of competing and closely related broken symmetry states, some of which have non-zero quantized Hall conductivities. Here we explore those states by stabilizing them with external fields. Transport spectroscopy measurements reveal two distinct states that have two quantum units of Hall conductivity, stabilized by large magnetic and electric fields, respectively. The majority spins of both phases form a quantum anomalous Hall state, and the minority spins constitute a Kekul{\'{e}} state with spontaneous valley coherence for phase I and a quantum valley Hall state for phase II.

However, despite promising single-atom nanotechnologies[6], there remain substantial challenges in coupling such qubits and addressing them individually.

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {Intelligence Quotient (IQ) Test is a set of standardized questions designed to evaluate human intelligence. Verbal comprehension questions appear very frequently in IQ tests, which measure human's verbal ability including the understanding of the words with multiple senses, the synonyms and antonyms, and the analogies among words. In this work, we explore whether such tests can be solved automatically by artificial intelligence technologies, especially the deep learning technologies that are recently developed and successfully applied in a number of fields. However, we found that the task was quite challenging, and simply applying existing technologies (e.g., word embedding) could not achieve a good performance, mainly due to the multiple senses of words and the complex relations among words. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel framework consisting of three components. First, we build a classifier to recognize the specific type of a verbal question (e.g., analogy, classification, synonym, or antonym). Second, we obtain distributed representations of words and relations by leveraging a novel word embedding method that considers the multi-sense nature of words and the relational knowledge among words (or their senses) contained in dictionaries. Third, for each specific type of questions, we propose a simple yet effective solver based on the obtained distributed word representations and relation representations. According to our experimental results, our proposed framework can not only outperform existing methods for solving verbal comprehension questions but also exceed the average performance of human beings. The results are highly encouraging, indicating that with appropriate uses of the deep learning technologies, we could be a further step closer to the true human intelligence.},

Here we present both an analytical description and a numerical simulation for this process, which agree reasonably with the experimental measurements. For the NV center under cyclic optical transition, our analytical formula not only provide a clear physics picture, but also allows controlling the nuclear spin dissipation by tuning an external magnetic field. For more general optical pumping, our analytical formula reveals significant contribu-tion to the nuclear spin dissipation due to electron random hopping into/out of the m = 0 (or m = ±1) subspace. This contribution is not suppressed even under saturated optical pumping and/or vanishing magnetic field, thus providing a possible solution to the puzzling observation of nuclear spin dephasing in zero perpendicular mag-netic field [M. V. G. Dutt et al., Science 316, 1312 (2007)]. It also implies that enhancing the degree of spin polarization of the nitrogen-vacancy center can reduce the effect of optical induced nuclear spin dissipation.},

Here, we focus on atomically precise graphene nanoribbons whose two short zigzag edges host exactly one localized electron each. Using the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope, the graphene nanoribbons are transferred from the metallic growth substrate onto insulating islands of NaCl in order to decouple their electronic structure from the metal. The absence of charge transfer and hybridization with the substrate is confirmed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), which reveals a pair of occupied / unoccupied edge states. Their large energy splitting of 1.9 eV is in accordance with ab initio many-body perturbation theory calculations and reflects the dominant role of electron-electron interactions in these localized states.},

Difficulty fabricating HgTe quantum wells has, moreover, hampered their widespread use. With the goal of breaking this logjam we provide a blueprint for stabilizing a robust TI state in a more readily available two-dimensional material---graphene. Using symmetry arguments, density functional theory, and tight-binding simulations, we predict that graphene endowed with certain heavy adatoms realizes a TI with substantial band gap. For indium and thallium, our most promising adatom candidates, a modest 6{\%} coverage produces an estimated gap near 80K and 240K, respectively, which should be detectable in transport or spectroscopic measurements.

abstract = {Bayesian nonparametric models, such as Gaussian processes, provide a compelling framework for automatic statistical modelling: these models have a high degree of flexibility, and automatically calibrated complexity. However, automating human expertise remains elusive, for example, Gaussian processes with standard kernels struggle on function extrapolation problems that are trivial for human learners. In this paper, we create function extrapolation problems and acquire human responses, and then design a kernel learning framework to reverse engineer the inductive biases of human learners across a set of behavioral experiments. We use the learned kernels to gain psychological insights and to extrapolate in human-like ways that go beyond traditional stationary and polynomial kernels. Finally, we investigate Occam's razor in human and Gaussian process based function learning.},

The spin-valley coupling at the valence-band edges suppresses spin and valley relaxation, as flip of each index alone is forbidden by the valley-contrasting spin splitting. Valley Hall and spin Hall effects coexist in both electron-doped and hole-doped systems. Optical interband transitions have frequency-dependent polarization selection rules which allow selective photoexcitation of carriers with various combination of valley and spin indices. Photoinduced spin Hall and valley Hall effects can generate long lived spin and valley accumulations on sample boundaries. The physics discussed here provides a route towards the integration of valleytronics and spintronics in multivalley materials with strong spin-orbit coupling and inversion symmetry breaking.},

This “axial” current is the chiral (Adler-Bell-Jackiw) anomaly investigated in quantum field theory. We report the observation of a large, negative longitudinal magnetoresistance in the Dirac semimetal Na3Bi. The negative magnetoresistance is acutely sensitive to deviations of the direction of B from E and is incompatible with conventional transport. By rotating E (as well as B), we show that it is consistent with the prediction of the chiral anomaly.},

abstract = {Graphene has demonstrated great promise for future electronics technology as well as fundamental physics applications because of its linear energy-momentum dispersion relations which cross at the Dirac point. However, accessing the physics of the low-density region at the Dirac point has been difficult because of disorder that leaves the graphene with local microscopic electron and hole puddles. Efforts have been made to reduce the disorder by suspending graphene, leading to fabrication challenges and delicate devices which make local spectroscopic measurements difficult. Recently, it has been shown that placing graphene on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) yields improved device performance. Here we use scanning tunnelling microscopy to show that graphene conforms to hBN, as evidenced by the presence of Moir{\'{e}} patterns. However, contrary to predictions, this conformation does not lead to a sizeable band gap because of the misalignment of the lattices. Moreover, local spectroscopy measurements demonstrate that the electron-hole charge fluctuations are reduced by two orders of magnitude as compared with those on silicon oxide. This leads to charge fluctuations that are as small as in suspended graphene, opening up Dirac point physics to more diverse experiments.},

abstract = {The phase relation between quantum states represents an essential resource for the storage and processing of quantum information. While quantum phases are commonly controlled dynamically by tuning energetic interactions, utilizing geometric phases that accumulate during cyclic evolution may offer superior robustness to noise. To date, demonstrations of geometric phase control in solid-state systems rely on microwave fields that have limited spatial resolution. Here, we demonstrate an all-optical method based on stimulated Raman adiabatic passage to accumulate a geometric phase, the Berry phase, in an individual nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Using diffraction-limited laser light, we guide the NV center's spin along loops on the Bloch sphere to enclose arbitrary Berry phase and characterize these trajectories through time-resolved state tomography. We investigate the limits of this control due to loss of adiabiaticity and decoherence, as well as its robustness to noise intentionally introduced into the experimental control parameters, finding its resilience to be independent of the amount of Berry phase enclosed. These techniques set the foundation for optical geometric manipulation in future implementations of photonic networks of solid state qubits linked and controlled by light.},

Valley polarization, associated with the occupancy of degenerate, but quantum mechanically distinct valleys in momentum space, closely resembles spin polarization and has been proposed as a pseudospin carrier for the future quantum electronics. Valley exciton polarization has been created in the transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayers using excitation by circularly polarized light and has been detected both optically and electrically. In addition, the existence of coherence in the valley pseudospin has been identified experimentally. The manipulation of such valley coherence has, however, remained out of reach. Here we demonstrate an all-optical control of the valley coherence by means of the pseudomagnetic field associated with the optical Stark effect. Using below-bandgap circularly polarized light, we experimentally rotate the valley exciton pseudospin in monolayer WSe2 on the femtosecond time scale. Both the direction and speed of the rotation can be optically manipulated by tuning the dynamic phase of excitons in opposite valleys. This study completes the generation-manipulation-detection paradigm for valley pseudospin, enabling the platform of excitons in 2D materials for the control of this novel degree of freedom in solids.},

abstract = {Low-dimensional electronic systems have traditionally been obtained by electrostatically confining electrons, either in heterostructures or in intrinsically nanoscale materials such as single molecules, nanowires and graphene. Recently, a new method has emerged with the recognition that symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases, which occur in systems with an energy gap to quasiparticle excitations (such as insulators or superconductors), can host robust surface states that remain gapless as long as the relevant global symmetry remains unbroken. The nature of the charge carriers in SPT surface states is intimately tied to the symmetry of the bulk, resulting in one- and two-dimensional electronic systems with novel properties. For example, time reversal symmetry endows the massless charge carriers on the surface of a three-dimensional topological insulator with helicity, fixing the orientation of their spin relative to their momentum. Weakly breaking this symmetry generates a gap on the surface, resulting in charge carriers with finite effective mass and exotic spin textures. Analogous manipulations have yet to be demonstrated in two-dimensional topological insulators, where the primary example of a SPT phase is the quantum spin Hall state. Here we demonstrate experimentally that charge-neutral monolayer graphene has a quantum spin Hall state when it is subjected to a very large magnetic field angled with respect to the graphene plane. In contrast to time-reversal-symmetric systems, this state is protected by a symmetry of planar spin rotations that emerges as electron spins in a half-filled Landau level are polarized by the large magnetic field. The properties of the resulting helical edge states can be modulated by balancing the applied field against an intrinsic antiferromagnetic instability, which tends to spontaneously break the spin-rotation symmetry. In the resulting canted antiferromagnetic state, we observe transport signatures of gapped edge states, which constitute a new kind of one-dimensional electronic system with a tunable bandgap and an associated spin texture.},

abstract = {Most electronic devices exploit the electric charge of electrons, but it is also possible to build devices that rely on other properties of electrons. Spintronic devices, for example, make use of the spin of electrons. Valleytronics is a more recent development that relies on the fact that the conduction bands of some materials have two or more minima at equal energies but at different positions in momentum space. To make a valleytronic device it is necessary to control the number of electrons in these valleys, thereby producing a valley polarization. Single-layer MoS(2) is a promising material for valleytronics because both the conduction and valence band edges have two energy-degenerate valleys at the corners of the first Brillouin zone. Here, we demonstrate that optical pumping with circularly polarized light can achieve a valley polarization of 30{\%} in pristine monolayer MoS(2). Our results, and similar results by Mak et al., demonstrate the viability of optical valley control and valley-based electronic and optoelectronic applications in MoS(2) monolayers.},

abstract = {Chirally stacked N-layer graphene systems with N≥2 exhibit a variety of distinct broken symmetry states in which charge density contributions from different spins and valleys are spontaneously transferred between layers. We explain how these states are distinguished by their charge, spin, and valley Hall conductivities, by their orbital magnetizations, and by their edge state properties. We argue that valley Hall states have [N/2] edge channels per spin valley.},

abstract = {Pristine graphene is strongly diamagnetic. However, graphene with single carbon atom defects could exhibit paramagnetism. Theoretically, the $\pi$ magnetism induced by the monovacancy in graphene is characteristic of two spin-split density-of-states (DOS) peaks close to the Dirac point. Since its prediction, many experiments have attempted to study this $\pi$ magnetism in graphene, whereas only a notable resonance peak has been observed around the atomic defects, leaving the $\pi$ magnetism experimentally elusive. Here, we report direct experimental evidence of $\pi$ magnetism by using a scanning tunneling microscope. We demonstrate that the localized state of the atomic defects is split into two DOS peaks with energy separations of several tens of meV. Strong magnetic fields further increase the energy separations of the two spin-polarized peaks and lead to a Zeeman-like splitting. Unexpectedly, the effective g factor around the atomic defect is measured to be about 40, which is about 20 times larger than the g factor for electron spins.},

abstract = {When electrons are confined in two-dimensional materials, quantum-mechanically enhanced transport phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect can be observed. Graphene, consisting of an isolated single atomic layer of graphite, is an ideal realization of such a two-dimensional system. However, its behaviour is expected to differ markedly from the well-studied case of quantum wells in conventional semiconductor interfaces. This difference arises from the unique electronic properties of graphene, which exhibits electron-hole degeneracy and vanishing carrier mass near the point of charge neutrality. Indeed, a distinctive half-integer quantum Hall effect has been predicted theoretically, as has the existence of a non-zero Berry's phase (a geometric quantum phase) of the electron wavefunction--a consequence of the exceptional topology of the graphene band structure. Recent advances in micromechanical extraction and fabrication techniques for graphite structures now permit such exotic two-dimensional electron systems to be probed experimentally. Here we report an experimental investigation of magneto-transport in a high-mobility single layer of graphene. Adjusting the chemical potential with the use of the electric field effect, we observe an unusual half-integer quantum Hall effect for both electron and hole carriers in graphene. The relevance of Berry's phase to these experiments is confirmed by magneto-oscillations. In addition to their purely scientific interest, these unusual quantum transport phenomena may lead to new applications in carbon-based electronic and magneto-electronic devices.},

abstract = {We study the topological properties of quantum states for the spinless particle hopping in a M{\"{o}}bius ladder. This system can be regarded as a molecular device possibly engineered from the M{\"{o}}bius annulenes, which enjoys a pseudospin orbital interaction described by a non-Abelian gauge structure. It results from the nontrivial topology of configuration space and results in various observable effects, such as optical spectral splitting. The transmission spectrum through the M{\"{o}}bius molecular device is calculated to demonstrate a topological effect as destructive interferences in the conduction band. The induced interaction also leads to an entanglement between the transverse and longitudinal modes for any locally factorized state.},

abstract = {The design of high-finesse resonant cavities for electronic waves faces challenges due to short electron coherence lengths in solids. Complementing previous approaches to confine electronic waves by carefully positioned adatoms at clean metallic surfaces, we demonstrate an approach inspired by the peculiar acoustic phenomena in whispering galleries. Taking advantage of graphene's gate-tunable light-like carriers, we create whispering-gallery mode (WGM) resonators defined by circular pn junctions, induced by a scanning tunneling probe.We can tune the resonator size and the carrier concentration under the probe in a back-gated graphene device over a wide range. The WGM-type confinement and associated resonances are a new addition to the quantum electron-optics toolbox, paving the way to develop electronic lenses and resonators.},
