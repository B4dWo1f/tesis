# PhD Thesis
In this project I'll develop my PhD thesis (& learn git XD)

## To-Do
### General
- [ ] Convert all the figures to pdf (for faster compilation)
- [x] Add paper about QSH in multilayers
- [x] Use unitx in Appendix B
### Chapter 4
- [ ] Bands of bismuth, BN, Zeeman, SOC...
- [ ] Bands-DOS for Graphene with pz spectral weight
- [ ] Discussion of the low energy regime and Lieb's Theorem
- [ ] Conclusion
### Chapter 5
- [ ] Bands-DOS for Graphene with 1 adatom to show the spectral weight of the H
- [ ] Compare spectrum w/wo H adatom and 1 and 4 orbitals
### Chapter 6
- [ ] Bands-DOS for Graphene Bilayer with correct interlayer
