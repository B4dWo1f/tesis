# PhD Thesis
In this project I'll develop my PhD thesis (& learn git XD)

## To-Do
### General
- [ ] Convert all the figures to pdf (for faster compilation)
- [x] Add paper about QSH in multilayers
- [x] Use unitx in Appendix B
- [ ] Bibliography
### Introduction
- [ ] Introduction
### Chapter 2
- [ ] Finish bullshit of quantum computation
- [ ] Pretty graph of quantum speed-up
### Chapter 3
- [ ] Overview of existing physical implementations
- [ ] Morello's status and achivements
- [ ] Pretty graph for spectrum evolution (including wave-functions)
- [ ] Discuss splittings and order of wave-functions
- [ ] Spectrum and discussion of 2 Qubits Hamiltonian
- [ ] Graphene analogue
### Chapter 4
- [ ] Neighbouring cells in graphene lattice
- [ ] Finish bullshit of capabilities of SK
- [ ] Explain decoupling between distance/orientation?
- [ ] Explain limits of SK?
- [ ] Bands of bismuth
- [ ] Bands of BN
- [ ] Bands of G with Zeeman, SOC...
#### Low Energy
- [ ] Discussion of the low energy regime and Lieb's Theorem
- [ ] Bands-DOS for Graphene with pz spectral weight
#### QSH
- [ ] Softer intro to QSH. JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS
### Chapter 5
- [ ] Compare spectrum w/wo H adatom and 1 and 4 orbitals
- [ ] Reorganize FULL finite-system section
- [ ] Brief discussion for 1-D with traslation symmetry
- [ ] Brief discussion for 2-D with traslation symmetry
- [ ] Softer intro to single vac limit
- [ ] KPM Appendix?
### Chapter 6
- [ ] Justify neglecting 2nd neig hopping (2CC dist is 2.42angs, interlayer is 3 angs)
- [x] Bands-DOS for Graphene Bilayer. Add panel with zoom to K point
- [ ] Bands-DOS for Graphene Bilayer with correct interlayer, full DOS, pz wg
- [ ] Effect of electric field for 0-D and infinite
- [ ] Finish Kondo calculation
### Chapter 7
- [ ] Fucking Spin-lifetimes
### Calculations
- [ ] Many-Body representation of the 2 fermions 2 sites system (6x6)
