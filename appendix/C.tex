Given a general one-body operator
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{O} = \sum_i\mathcal{O}_i
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{O}_i$ is an operator acting only in the i-th particle, it can be written in second quantization as follows
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{O} = \sum_{m,n}\bra{\psi_m}O_1\ket{\psi_n}\crea{a}{m}\des{a}{n}
\end{equation}

For the case of the spin operator $S^a$

The field operator for a particle at position $\vec{r}$ can be written as
\begin{equation}
  \crea{\Psi}{\sigma}(\vec{r}) =
  \sum_{k,n}\psi^*_{k,n}(\vec{r})\crea{c}{k,n,\sigma} +
  \sum_{k,n'}\psi^*_{k,n'}(\vec{r})\crea{v}{k,n',\sigma} +
  \phi^*_0(\vec{r})\crea{z}{\sigma}
\end{equation}

where $\sigma$ labels the spin degree of freedom, $k$ labels points in the BZ, $n$ is the band index, for the first term $n$ runs over the bands bellow the Fermi level, while for the second term it run over the conduction bands.
The last term corresponds to the mid-gap state located around the vacancy/adatom.

The density operator reads
\begin{equation}
  \rho(\vec{r})=\sum_\sigma\crea{\Psi}{\sigma}(\vec{r})\des{\Psi}{\sigma}(\vec{r})
\end{equation}
so it consists of 9 terms containing quadruples of creation/destruction operators like these
\begin{equation*}
  \rho(\vec{r}) \propto
  \#\crea{c}{}\des{c}{} + \#\crea{c}{}\des{v}{} + \#\crea{c}{}\des{z}{} +
  \#\crea{v}{}\des{c}{} + \#\crea{v}{}\des{v}{} + \#\crea{v}{}\des{z}{} +
  \#\crea{z}{}\des{c}{} + \#\crea{z}{}\des{v}{} + \#\crea{z}{}\des{z}{}
\end{equation*}
