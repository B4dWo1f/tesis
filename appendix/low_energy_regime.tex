\chapter{Low Energy Regime}
In this appendix we point out the correspondence between adatoms and vacancies in graphene based systems and the validity of such assumption. This topic is far from new\cite{} but it is worth it to have it here for the sake of completeness.

The low energy regime of graphene is governed by the $p_z$ atoms, (or $\pi$-atoms)
