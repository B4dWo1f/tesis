Graphene is one of the most studied materials in history\cite{KatsnelsonBook, Geim2007, Murakami2009, CastroNeto2009a,
Mas-Balleste2011, Konschuh2011a, Cooper2012, Han2014, Sadurni2014, Rozhkov2016}.
Even before its experimental discovery\cite{Novoselov2004, Novoselov2005},
extensive research was devoted to it\cite{Wallace1947, VanBommel1975, Semenoff1984, Haldane1988, Forbeaux1998, Oshima2000}.
All the basic properties have been discussed profusely, yet, for the sake of completeness I will make a brief recap of all the properties relevant for the rest of this thesis.\\

Graphene consists of a two-dimensional array of carbon, $C$, atoms arranged in a honeycomb structure\cite{Huang2011} % TODO more references
like the one shown in \fref{graphene_summary}(a,b) % ~$a,b)$.
Unless otherwise stated, we will consider that the unstrained atomic distance between carbon atoms is $d_{C-C}=a=\SI{1.4}{\angstrom}$ in accordance with literature\cite{KatsnelsonBook, Cooper2012, Ishigami2007}. % TODO more biblio

The honeycomb structure is not a Bravais lattice, so, in order to describe the system in terms of Bloch functions, we have to choose a unit cell and the appropriate lattice vectors to tessellate the space.
Naturally there are infinite possibilities to do so, but the simplest one is that depicted in \fref{graphene_summary}b).
The simplest unit cell and  Bravais lattice with which we can describe graphene is the one depicted in \fref{graphene_summary}a). It consists of two atoms in the positions
\begin{equation}
\vec{r}_0 = \tfrac{a}{2}(-1,0,0) \quad;\quad
\vec{r}_1 = \tfrac{a}{2}(1,0,0),
\label{at_pos}
\end{equation}
The lattice vectors that define the triangular Bravais lattice are:
\begin{equation}
\vec{a}_1 = \tfrac{a}{2}\left(3,\sqrt{3},0\right) \quad;\quad
\vec{a}_2 = \tfrac{a}{2}\left(3,-\sqrt{3},0\right)
\label{latt_vec}
\end{equation}
This geometry defines a hexagonal Wigner-Seitz cell (blue region on \fref{graphene_summary}b)) with area $\sim\SI{5.1}{\angstrom\squared}$.

The reciprocal lattice vectors are depicted in \fref{graphene_summary}c) and can be easily calculated using the relation: $\vec{a}_i\vec{b}_j=2\pi\delta_{ij}$. Notice that the canonical \ac{fbz} shown in \fref{graphene_summary}c) is an hexagon (just like the Wignerâ€“Seitz cell) but nothing changes if instead we use the gray shadowed region, which is much more convenient for computational calculations.\\


Once the lattice structure is clear, we turn to the electronic properties. Carbon atoms have 6 electrons allocated in five orbitals distributed in the layers with quantum number $n\in\{1,2\}$.
The first two electrons are in the $1s$ level, two more in the $2s$ level and finally another two \acp{el} in the $2p$ levels (\fref{orbitals}).

%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%
Since the orbitals $n=1$ are doubly occupied and far down in energy, there is no need to consider them. The $2s$ level is also full, but they show a strong hopping with the $p$ orbitals which are around the Fermi energy so we will consider their contribution. The $2p$ orbitals are the closest to the Fermi level, hence they will play a major role in the chemistry of graphene.\\

With this description of the system we can build a basis which will have four orbitals per Carbon atom:
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{B}_4 = \left\{
  \ket{\phi^1_{s}},\ket{\phi^1_{p_x}},\ket{\phi^1_{p_y}},\ket{\phi^1_{p_z}},
  \dots,
  \ket{\phi^n_{s}},\ket{\phi^n_{p_x}},\ket{\phi^n_{p_y}},\ket{\phi^n_{p_z}}
  \right\}
\label{basis4}
\end{equation}
where the superscript points out the atom and the subscript shows the corresponding orbital. The bands resulting from this description are shown in \fref{graphene_summary}d). We will delve in the physical properties later on, but for now it should suffice to point out the linear dispersion in the $K$ and $K'$ points around the Fermi energy $E_F=\SI{0}{\eV}$ as well as the decoupling of the two bands (from the $p_z$ manifold) colored in orange. The \ac{dos} show that the orbitals involved only have weight in those two bands as we will see later.

In many cases we will not be interested in the properties of the orbitals that do not contribute to those two bands. In those cases we will reduce our basis and consider only one orbital per Carbon atom, resulting in the basis:
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{B}_1 = \left\{\ket{\phi^1_{p_z}}, \ket{\phi^2_{p_z}},\dots, \ket{\phi^n_{p_z}}\right\}
\label{basis1}
\end{equation}

In the next section we show the details of the model used to build the Hamiltonians used all along this thesis.


\section{Slater-Koster tight-binding model}
\label{ssec:SK}
Generally the hopping parameters are an input in any \ac{tb} model. They are usually calculated by fitting eigenvalues (and possibly eigenfunctions) obtained from \ac{dft} calculations. Another way to calculate the hopping parameters is to project the eigenfunctions into a basis of localized atomic orbitals so the interpretation in terms of hydrogenoid orbitals is easier.

As a system grows complex, more and more parameters are needed to describe it. In fact, the number of hoppings grows with the size of the basis, $n_\mathcal{B}$, as $\sum^{n_\mathcal{B}}_i i$. Nevertheless since the number of different orbitals is finite and a larger basis means only a more complex arrangement of orbitals, one could expect that not every parameter is completely independent from the others.

\label{fig:SK}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier
%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%
The \ac{sk} approximation\cite{Slater1954} takes into account the symmetry of the atomic orbitals to reduce the number of parameters needed since some of them are related by rotations or other symmetry operations.

The \ac{sk} model encodes the two-center hopping integrals $t_{\phi_1-\phi_2} = \bra{\phi_1(\vec{r})}H'(\vec{r},\vec{r}')\ket{\phi_2(\vec{r'})}$ along high symmetry directions in a set of constants: $V_{\alpha\alpha'm}$, where $\alpha$ and $\alpha'$ label the orbitals and m refer to the component of angular momentum around the line between the center of the two orbitals. In \fref{fig:SK}a) it can be seen how the $V_{sp\pi}$ and $V_{sp\sigma}$ are defined\footnote{Notice that $V_{sp\pi}$ automatically vanishes because of the symmetry of the orbitals.}
It is important to notice that the radial information is enclosed in the \ac{sk} parameters. In general the \ac{sk} parameters will decrease as the distance between the orbitals increases, the exact ratio depends on the orbitals and different approximations can be found in the literature.\cite{Harrison1930}\\


By decomposing the hopping integrals in parallel and perpendicular components we reduce the number of parameters needed to account for all possible hoppings. For instance, we only need two parameters: $V_{pp\sigma}$ and $V_{pp\pi}$ in order to express all six $p-p$ hoppings.

This description of the hopping parameters also accounts for the symmetry of the orbitals. For instance \fref{fig:SK}c) it is shown the relation between the hoppings $t_{p_{z},p_{x}}$ and $t_{p_{z},p_{y}}$. If we forget about the labels in the axis, we can realize that these two hoppings are in fact equivalent since one can be obtained as a rotation of the other.

If we define the unitary vector $\hat{r} = \vec{r}/|\vec{r}|$ and its components $\hat{r}=(l,m,n)$ we can see that
\begin{equation}
  t_{p_{z},p_{x}} (l,m,n) = t_{p_{z},p_{y}}(m,l,n)
\end{equation}
notice that the change in the arguments is equivalent to perform a rotation of the vector $\vec{r}$ of $-\pi/2$ around the $Z$ axis.\\

The \ac{sk} description of the \ac{tb} hopping integrals allows the formulation of all the hoppings in terms of a few parameters which encode the distance between orbitals at the same time that it preserves the angular information in the analytical formulation which can be checked in appendix \ref{SKhoppings}.


\subsection{Slater-Koster versatility}
\subsubsection{Angular dependence}
An example of this decoupling can be shown in the following gedankenexperiment. Let us consider graphene and let us displace vertically a little bit one of the sublattices\footnote{If it boggles your mind you can shift all the atomic positions to keep the $C$-$C$ distance as $a=\SI{1.4}{\angstrom}$}
so we end up with a slightly distorted graphene in which not all the atoms are in the same plane. This shift out of the plane has an important effect in the band structure since it breaks the mirror symmetry that kept the $p_z$ orbitals isolated from every other orbital.
This mixing of the $p_z$ manifold with all the other orbitals happens mainly at $\Gamma$ and it can be seen in both in the band structure and in the \ac{dos}

This simple example shows how easy it is to account for geometric distortions. The buckling used in this example is similar to that naturally occurring in other materials such as 2-D Bismuth crystals.

\subsubsection{Other materials}
Once we have the machinery to build \ac{sk} hamiltonians, simply by changing the \ac{sk} parameters we can describe different materials.
In this section we compare graphene, bismuth and $h-BN$  % TODO cite
as simple examples where the \ac{sk} description works well.\\

%
% Graphene TB
%
In order to describe graphene, different sets of parameters can be found in the literature\cite{}. Nevertheless some of the parameters used here have been fitted from \ac{dft} calculations. The \ac{sk} parameters in $\si{\eV}$ used for graphene are:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{l|cccc}
    Hopping & V_{ss\sigma} & V_{sp\sigma} & V_{pp\sigma} & V_{pp\pi} \\ \hline
    C-C & -7.76 & 8.16 & 7.48 & -2.7 \\
    C-H & -6.84 & 7.81 & \text{--} & \text{--}
  \end{array}\qquad\qquad
  \begin{array}{c|cccc}
    \text{On-site} & s & p_x & p_y & p_z \\ \hline
    C & -8.8 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\
    H & -2.5 &     &     &
  \end{array}
\label{G_SK_params}
\end{equation}
where the hoppings with a hypothetical $H$ atom have been included for later convenience.\\

To describe the relevant features of $h-BN$ it suffices to add a different on-site energy for the $B$ and $N$ ($E_{B} = -E_{N} =\SI{2.5}{\eV}$) atoms while keeping the inter-atomic hoppings similar to those of graphene.\\

Bismuth is a little bit more complex since an accurate description requires up to third neighbor hoppings (and spin-orbit coupling as well, which we will neglect for the moment). The \ac{sk} parameters, taken from~\citen{Liu1995} are:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{c|cccc}
    Hopping & V_{ss\sigma} & V_{sp\sigma} & V_{pp\sigma} & V_{pp\pi} \\ \hline
    1 & -0.608 & 1.32 & 1.854 & -0.6 \\
    2 & -0.384 & 0.433 & 1.396 & -0.344 \\
    3 & \text{--} & \text{--} & 0.156 & \text{--}
  \end{array}\quad\qquad
  \begin{array}{c|cc}
     \text{On-site} & s & p_{x,y,z} \\ \hline
    Bi & -10.906 & -0.486
  \end{array}
\label{Bi_SK_params}
\end{equation}\\

The respective band structure of all these materials is shown in \fref{SKbands}.
For all panels, the color, $\mathcal{C}$ represents the weight of the $p_z$ orbital in each state:
\begin{equation*}
   \mathcal{C} = \bra{\psi_{\alpha}}\mathcal{O}_{p_z}\ket{\psi_{\alpha}}
\end{equation*}
where $\mathcal{O}_{p_z}$ is the $p_z$ projector operator and $\ket{\psi_{\alpha}}$ are the Hamiltonian eigenfunctions.
\begin{equation*}
  H\ket{\psi_{\alpha}} = E_{\alpha}\ket{\psi_{\alpha}} \qquad ; \qquad
   \ket{\psi} = \sum_i c_i\ket{\phi_i} \quad

\section{Basic Properties}
\label{sec:graphene_basic_properties}
%
%  General description of bands
%  Low energy,
%
We are going to use a \ac{tb} model in the \ac{sk} approximation with four orbitals per carbon atom to describe graphene. The band structure obtained with this model is shown in \fref{bandsG}.

The first thing to notice about the graphene bands is the orbital distribution of the bands. As mentioned before the $p_z$ orbitals are responsible for the central bands, crossing the Fermi energy at $E_F=\SI{0.0}{\eV}$. Due to the mirror symmetry (with respect to the atomic plane), every hopping between the $\sigma$-orbitals and $p_z$ vanishes exactly (see the definition of $V_{sp\sigma}$ in \fref{orbitals}a)).
The presence of \textit{only} $p_z$ orbitals around the Fermi energy makes it possible to describe the system solely with these orbitals.

The second thing to notice is that around the Fermi level, the band dispersion is linear. In particular, the band structure forms two pairs of cones in the $K$ and $K'$ points of the \ac{fbz}. This famous feature %TODO cite
%is responsible for many of the interesting properties of graphene %TODO cite{Klein, HEP analogies, anomalies, topology,...}

\label{bandsG}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier
%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%
In fact it is an easy exercise to calculate the band dispersion analytically. The Hamiltonian (already in the $k$-space) is:
\begin{equation}
   H(\vec{k}) = H_0 + V_1 e^{-i\vec{k}\vec{a}_1} + V_2 e^{-i\vec{k}\vec{a}_2}+
   V^{\dagger}_1 e^{i\vec{k}\vec{a}_1} + V^{\dagger}_2 e^{i\vec{k}\vec{a}_2}
\label{hk}
\end{equation}
where, in the one orbital basis $\mathcal{B}_1$ described by \eqref{basis1} can be written as
\begin{equation}
   H_0 = \left(\begin{array}{cc}
               \varepsilon_A & t \\
               t & \varepsilon_B
         \end{array}\right) \quad;\quad
   V_1 = V_2 = \left(\begin{array}{cc}
                     0 & 0 \\
                     t & 0
               \end{array}\right)
\end{equation}
which allows us to rewrite eq. \eqref{hk} as
\begin{equation}
  H(\vec{k})=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
        \varepsilon_{A} & tf(\vec{k}) \\
  tf^{\dagger}(\vec{k}) & \varepsilon_{B}
  \end{array}\right) \quad;\quad
  f(\vec{k}) = 1 + e^{-i\vec{k}\vec{a}_{1}}+
e^{-i\vec{k}\vec{a}_{2}}
\end{equation}
where we have assumed that the hopping integral between two coplanar $p_z$ orbitals is real. We have explicitly added a different on-site energy $\varepsilon_{A/B}$ for each of the sublattices

Finding the eigenvalues of $H(\vec{k})$ we obtain
\begin{equation}
  E(\vec{k})=\frac{\varepsilon_{B}-\varepsilon_{A}}{2}\pm
  \sqrt{\frac{\varepsilon^{2}_{A}+\varepsilon^{2}_{B}}{4}-
  \frac{\varepsilon_{A}\varepsilon_{B}}{2}-
  4\left(\varepsilon_{A}\varepsilon_{B}-t^2ff^{\dagger}\right) }
\end{equation}
yet in graphene these parameters vanish: $\varepsilon_{A}=\varepsilon_{B}=\varepsilon=0$ so the dispersion for the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian:
\begin{equation}
  E(\vec{k})=\pm\sqrt{4t^2ff^{\dagger}} = \pm2|tf|
\end{equation}

%
% TODO Dirac derivation
%

\subsection{Mass}
If we were to consider not graphene but some other material with the same structure but different on-site energies for each sublattice, a so-called ``mass'' term would have to be introduced. This was hinted during the single orbital description by keeping the hypothetical on-site energies.
The main effect of such a term is to open a trivial gap at the Dirac points.

\subsection{Zeeman}
The application of an external magnetic field usually has several effects in a material. While a lot of interesting Physics is developed around the formation of Landau levels, we will restrict our study to the simpler case of the Zeeman splitting of the energy levels. This effect consists of a symmetric splitting of up ($\uaw$) and down ($\daw$) spin, resulting in a vertical shift the bands for each spin flavor.

\subsection{Electric field and Rashba}
An electric field has several effects, that will be discussed later on along the thesis. It should suffice for now to discuss briefly the two main consequences.
The first feature is that an electric field would deform the atomic orbitals, breaking the mirror symmetry that protects the $\pi$-manifold. The breaking of this symmetry opens an effective channel for mixing $s$ and $p_z$ orbitals.

This effect, alongside the \ac{soc} opens a spin-flip channel via the following process: an $\uaw$ electron in a $p_z$ can transition to a $s$ orbital in the same atom, then to a $p_{x/y}$ orbital, which is connected via \ac{soc} with a $p_z$ with spin $\daw$.

We will neglect this process since both the mixing of the $s$ and the $p_z$ orbital\cite{Min2006} and the \ac{soc}\cite{Kane2005, Yao2007, Boettger2007,Gmitra2009} are quite small.

If we consider bilayer graphene, the application of an electric field has another important effect. It shifts the on-site energy of each layer which results in an opening of a gap in the band structure. This results in a very useful feature that will be exploited throughout the thesis.


\subsection{Spin-Orbit coupling}
\label{sec:soc}
The \acf{soc} is relativistic interaction that can be interpreted in classical terms (allowing the existence of spin in classical physics) as the interaction between the spin of the electron and the electrostatic potential of the nucleus.

In most of this section we are going to use the four orbital basis \eqref{basis4} with the geometry of \fref{graphene_summary}b), also described in the firs section of the chapter. Our Hamiltonian will have two atoms per unit cell and four orbitals per atom, so it will be a $8\times8$ matrix. When interactions concerning the spin are taken into account, the basis will be doubled with the following order:
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{B}^{s}_4 = \left\{
  \ket{\phi^1_{s\uaw}},
  \ket{\phi^1_{s\daw}},
  \ket{\phi^1_{p_x\uaw}},
  \ket{\phi^1_{p_x\daw}},
  \ket{\phi^1_{p_y\uaw}},
  \ket{\phi^1_{p_y\daw}},
  \dots,
  \ket{\phi^n_{p_z\uaw}},
  \ket{\phi^n_{p_z\daw}}
  \right\}
\label{basis4spin}
\end{equation}

So the Hamiltonian term can be written as follows:
\begin{equation}
   H_{SO}= \lambda_{SO}\vec{L}\vec{S}
\label{soc}
\end{equation}

which is often rewritten as
\begin{equation}
   H_{SO} = \lambda_{SO}\left[L_zS_z+
   \frac{1}{2}\left(L^{+}S^{-}+L^{-}S^{+}\right)\right]
\end{equation}
just by taking into account the relations
\begin{equation*}
   S^{+} = S_x + iS_y \quad;\quad
   S^{-} = S_x - iS_y
\end{equation*}

\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier
%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%

\subsection{Interlayer}
The last term that we will be interested in is the interlayer coupling when the system is formed by more than one layer of graphene. This term and its effects will be discussed later on, so we will just hint here an interesting way to think about it, leaving for later a deeper analysis.

We can consider the adiabatic formation of bilayer graphene (or $n$-layer graphene, for that matter) by considering two layers of graphene infinitely apart and bringing them together.
We can use the following basis to describe such a system:
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{B}_1 = \left\{\ket{\phi_{1A}}, \ket{\phi_{1B}},
                        \ket{\phi_{2A}}, \ket{\phi_{2B}}\right\}
\end{equation}
where the numbers label the layer and the letters the sublattice.

Since the two layers are infinitely apart, we can consider no interaction between them, hence we can describe the Hamiltonian of the system at the initial moment as two disconnected sectors of the same Hamiltonian, equivalent to the limit $\eta\rightarrow0$ in eq.~\eqref{Gbi}. The Hamiltonian in the one orbital basis $\mathcal{B}_1$ reads:
\begin{equation}
  H = \left(\begin{array}{cc|cc}
     0 & tf(\vec{k}) & 0 & 0 \\
     tf(\vec{k}) & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \hline
     0 & 0 & 0 & tf(\vec{k}) \\
     0 & 0 & tf(\vec{k}) & 0
  \end{array}\right) + 
  \eta \left(\begin{array}{cc|cc}
     0 & 0  & 0  & 0 \\
     0 & 0  & t' & 0 \\ \hline
     0 & t' & 0  & 0 \\
     0 & 0  & 0  & 0
  \end{array}\right)
\label{Gbi}
\end{equation}
$\eta$ will be used as a dummy parameter to switch on and off the interlayer coupling adiabatically.
When a more complex basis is used, all the \ac{sk} parameters will be scaled so that the interlayer hopping among $p_z$ orbitals is $t'=\SI{0.4}{\eV}$ in accordance with the literature\cite{KatsnelsonBook}.

%\section{Islands}
%With these parameters we consider an armchair hexagonal nanoisland ($\sim10^4-10^5$ $C$ atoms). Such a system is 0-dimensional, hence, no band structure can be defined but rather just the spectrum. Nevertheless, in the limit of an infinite island, the physical properties of graphene should be recovered.
%We can get an idea of how far from real graphene we are by considering the confinement gap. Graphene is famously known for not having a gap in the band structure. Graphene nanoislands do have a gap due to its finite size, but the larger the island, the smaller the gap until in the limit of an infinite island (graphene) the gap shall disappear. The dependence of the gap and the size of the island can be estimated as a free particle in a box of size $L$, roughly $\Delta\sim\frac{1}{L^2}$. Performing the actual calculation we can obtain see the dependence of the gap with the size of the island (see Fig.~\ref{confinement}) and estimate the necessary dimensions for our calculations.

%When 4 orbitals are considered, the breaking of the $C_3$ symmetry at the edges (ie, the $C$ atoms in the edges are missing 1 neighbor) results in near-zero energy states due to the unmet $\sigma$ bonds, combination of $s$, $p_x$ and $p_y$. In order to get rid of these artificious states we consider the island edges to be pasivated by Hydrogen atoms as shown in Fig.~\ref{confinement}. This way the dangling bonds hybridize and get lifted/drowned to the $\sigma$ manifolds.
%Although physically founded, the inclusion of $H$ pasivating atoms is somehow a technical construct to remove the dangling bonds from the low energy spectrum, hence, the strength of the $C-H$ bonds is not relevant and it should suffice to shift the $\sigma$ states far away from the low energy part of the spectrum.
