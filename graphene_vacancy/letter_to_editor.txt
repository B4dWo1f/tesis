Dear editor


we resubmit our manuscript "Anomalous magnetism in hydrogenated
graphene" to Physical Review B. We have addressed the comments 
of the referees and modified the manuscript accordingly. Given
the positive recommendation of the second referee and
our clarifications to the comments of the first referee, we hope you
consider our paper suitable for publication in Physical Review B



Yours sincerely
N. Garcia-Martinez, J. L. Lado, D. Jacob and J. Fernandez-Rossier
